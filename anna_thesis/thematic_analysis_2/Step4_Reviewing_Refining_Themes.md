# Step 4: Reviewing and Refining Themes


---

# LEVEL 1: EXTRACT-LEVEL REVIEW

## Theme 1: The Human Trust Architecture

### Coherence Check: Are all extracts "about the same thing"?

**Reviewing the 6 extracts assigned:**

| Extract | Speaker | Core Content | Fits Theme? | Issue? |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "I need challenge without shame... shame blocks learning" | Katharina | What builds trust | ✓ YES | None |
| "My stomach dropped... I made myself vulnerable, and he slapped it away" | Tobias | What breaks trust | ✓ YES | None |
| "Competence... does the person actually know... I also value honesty about uncertainty" | Simon | Trust components | ✓ YES | None |
| "I need them to ask good questions... If they only give advice, then it is like a blog post" | Amir | Trust-building behavior | ✓ YES | None |
| "The coach said it like, shut up. The colleague said it like, you are not alone" | Tobias | Same words, different impact | ✓ YES | None |
| "Confidentiality, structure, competence in my market, empathy, challenge, consistency, being seen" | Katharina | Trust drivers list | ✓ YES | None |

**Verdict:** All 6 extracts cohere around the same organizing idea (what builds/breaks trust in humans).

### Internal Consistency Check

**Question:** Should "Builders" and "Breakers" be separate themes?

**Analysis:**
- Cluster A (Builders): 25 codes, 168 instances
- Cluster B (Breakers): 24 codes, 108 instances
- They are conceptually related (two sides of one coin)
- Many participants describe both in the same breath
- Separating would create artificial division

**Decision:** KEEP as single theme with clear sub-themes (Builders vs. Breakers)

### Hidden Meaning Split Check

**Question:** Is there a second meaning hiding in this theme?

**Found:** Some extracts are about **somatic/embodied** experience of trust (stomach dropping, throat tightening) vs. **cognitive** components (competence, confidentiality).

**Decision:** Add sub-theme 1e: "Somatic Trust" to capture the embodied dimension. NOT a split—it's part of the same phenomenon (trust as whole-person experience).

### Refinement Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| KEEP | Theme 1 as unified "Trust Architecture" |
| ADD | Sub-theme 1e: Somatic/embodied trust experience |
| CLARIFY | Builders and Breakers are sub-themes, not separate themes |

---

## Theme 2: AI's Unique Safety — The Judgment-Free Zone

### Coherence Check: Are all extracts "about the same thing"?

| Extract | Speaker | Core Content | Fits Theme? | Issue? |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "It does not require me to perform confidence... I can write, I am scared" | Amir | Non-judgment enables disclosure | ✓ YES | None |
| "I come from a culture where you have pride... The AI is like, okay, you can be messy here" | Amir | Cultural safety | ✓ YES | None |
| "Emotionally, it cannot shame me... AI does not say, you are too sensitive" | Tobias | No shame from AI | ✓ YES | None |
| "No judgement. With humans, I sometimes feel judged... With AI, I can say anything" | Laura #2 | AI vs human judgment contrast | ✓ YES | None |
| "It's comforting in a shallow way because it doesn't judge me. But it doesn't replace a friend" | Daniel | Bounded safety | ✓ YES | None |
| "It is like, not companionship, but containment. Like a container for thoughts" | Amir | Container metaphor | ✓ YES | None |

**Verdict:** All 6 extracts cohere around AI's non-judgment as safety. The "bounded" extracts (Daniel, Amir's container) are part of the same theme—they describe limits of this safety.

### Internal Consistency Check

**Question:** Should AI limitations (Cluster D) be a separate theme from AI safety (Cluster C)?

**Analysis:**
- Cluster C (Safety): What AI provides (non-judgment)
- Cluster D (Limitations): What AI lacks (context, accuracy, depth)
- They are RELATED but DIFFERENT phenomena
- Safety is about what AI enables; Limitations is about what AI cannot do

**Decision:** SPLIT Theme 2 into:
- Theme 2A: AI's Unique Safety (non-judgment, availability, container)
- Theme 2B: AI's Boundaries (limitations, distrust factors, privacy concerns)

Wait—let me reconsider. Participants often describe safety AND limitations in the same breath ("comforting in a shallow way"). The limitations ARE PART OF the safety narrative—they bound it.

**Revised Decision:** KEEP as single theme, but rename to emphasize both aspects: "AI's Bounded Safety: Non-Judgment as Shelter, with Limits"

### Hidden Meaning Split Check

**Question:** Is there a second meaning hiding?

**Found:** There's a distinction between:
1. **Emotional safety** (no judgment, can be messy)
2. **Epistemic caution** (don't trust AI for facts, verify)

These are different—one is about feeling safe, one is about trusting output accuracy.

**Decision:** Keep emotional safety in Theme 2. Move epistemic caution (hallucinations, overconfidence, verification) to Theme 3 (Complementary Competencies) as part of "what AI is NOT good for."

### Refinement Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| KEEP | Theme 2 focused on psychological safety/non-judgment |
| MOVE | Epistemic distrust codes (hallucination, overconfidence) to Theme 3's "AI limitations" |
| ADD | Sub-theme 2d: Privacy as constraint on disclosure (self-censoring) |
| RENAME | Consider: "The Judgment-Free Zone: Safety Through Absence" |

---

## Theme 3: Complementary Competencies — What Each Does Well

### Coherence Check: Are all extracts "about the same thing"?

| Extract | Speaker | Core Content | Fits Theme? | Issue? |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "AI can turn chaos into steps. And then humans can validate the steps" | Laura #2 | Division of labor | ✓ YES | None |
| "AI can generate templates and reminders, but human accountability was what made me actually do it" | Katharina | Human accountability | ✓ YES | None |
| "AI for execution and structure, humans for meaning and courage" | Silvia | Role distinction | ✓ YES | None |
| "Human, definitely. Someone inside or with deep industry knowledge... AI can give general ideas but it does not know the informal parts" | Tobias | Human contextual knowledge | ✓ YES | None |
| "When it is about social context, like office politics, or negotiating salary... AI can give advice, but humans know reality" | Amir | Human for social nuance | ✓ YES | None |
| "It reduced stress, because the blank page problem is real" | Simon | AI for starting | ✓ YES | None |

**Verdict:** All extracts cohere around the idea of different competencies for different tasks.

### Internal Consistency Check

**Question:** Is this theme duplicating Theme 6 (Hybrid Ideal)?

**Analysis:**
- Theme 3: WHAT each modality does well (task-specific strengths)
- Theme 6: HOW to combine them (sequencing, workflow)
- They are related but distinct: Theme 3 = capabilities; Theme 6 = application

**Decision:** KEEP separate, but ensure clear boundaries:
- Theme 3: Lists/describes what AI vs humans are good for
- Theme 6: Describes the preferred workflow for combining them

### Hidden Meaning Split Check

**Question:** Is there a second meaning hiding?

**Found:** Two distinct aspects:
1. **Task-specific competencies** (AI for drafting, humans for context)
2. **Effectiveness indicators** (what counts as "working")

The effectiveness indicators (clarity, action, reduced anxiety) are NOT about AI vs humans—they're about what effectiveness means.

**Decision:** REMOVE effectiveness indicator codes from Theme 3. They belong in the contextual layer (Cluster K) and will be woven into the analysis, not as a theme.

### Refinement Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| KEEP | Theme 3 focused on task-specific competencies |
| ADD | AI limitation codes (hallucination, lack of context) as "what AI is NOT good for" |
| REMOVE | Effectiveness indicator codes (→ contextual layer) |
| CLARIFY | Boundary with Theme 6: This is WHAT, that is HOW |

---

## Theme 4: Trust as Gateway — The Mechanism of Depth

### Coherence Check: Are all extracts "about the same thing"?

| Extract | Speaker | Core Content | Fits Theme? | Issue? |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "For me, trust is the gateway. If I trust the coach, I admit the real thing I am avoiding" | Katharina | Trust enables disclosure | ✓ YES | None |
| "When I distrust the person, I do not share real information. I share a safe version" | Tobias | Distrust limits disclosure | ✓ YES | None |
| "If I do not trust, I will not share real fears. I will perform. Then the coach will coach the performance" | Amir | Performance problem | ✓ YES | None |
| "Trust is like a multiplier" | Daniel | Trust amplifies | ✓ YES | None |
| "Trust is like permission. If I trust... I will share the real problem, not the polite version" | Laura #2 | Trust as permission | ✓ YES | None |
| "If someone I trust would say it, I would do it. But because he said it after invalidating me..." | Tobias | Trust affects uptake | ✓ YES | None |

**Verdict:** All extracts cohere around the causal mechanism: trust → depth → quality → action.

### Internal Consistency Check

**Question:** Is this theme duplicating Themes 1 or 2 (what builds trust)?

**Analysis:**
- Themes 1 & 2: WHAT builds trust (components, conditions)
- Theme 4: WHY trust matters (the mechanism, the consequence)
- Clear distinction: what vs. why

**Decision:** KEEP separate. This is the CENTRAL theme for RQ3.

### Hidden Meaning Split Check

**Question:** Is there a second meaning hiding?

**Found:** The mechanism has TWO directions:
1. **Positive path:** Trust → deep disclosure → tailored advice → action
2. **Negative path:** Distrust → surface disclosure → generic advice → resistance

Both are part of the same mechanism (they're inverses). NOT a split.

**Decision:** KEEP as single theme with positive/negative paths as sub-themes.

### Refinement Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| KEEP | Theme 4 as central RQ3 mechanism |
| ADD | Visual diagram of the causal chain |
| CLARIFY | Sub-themes: Positive path, Negative path |
| EMPHASIZE | This is the PRIMARY answer to RQ3 |

---

## Theme 5: The Trust-Effectiveness Divergence

### Coherence Check: Are all extracts "about the same thing"?

| Extract | Speaker | Core Content | Fits Theme? | Issue? |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "I trusted her as a person. But she didn't give concrete actions. I left feeling warm, but nothing changed" | Daniel | Trusted, not effective | ✓ YES | None |
| "I talked to a university friend... very supportive but also very passive... But no concrete action" | Katharina | Trusted friend, ineffective | ✓ YES | None |
| "My friend in Barcelona... very supportive... I trusted her emotionally... But after the call, I still had no plan" | Laura #2 | Same pattern | ✓ YES | None |
| "It generates a decision principle that is very elegant... effective in giving me a language to think, but I do not trust it" | Amir | Effective, not trusted | ✓ YES | None |
| "His advice had useful parts... But I didn't trust him... I still took some tips, but it cost energy" | Daniel | Effective with friction | ✓ YES | None |
| "He gave a framework that is actually not stupid... If someone I trust would say it, I would do it" | Tobias | Good advice rejected | ✓ YES | None |

**Verdict:** All extracts cohere around the divergence between trust and effectiveness.

### Internal Consistency Check

**Question:** Does this theme contradict Theme 4 (Trust as Gateway)?

**Analysis:**
- Theme 4: Trust enables effectiveness (the mechanism)
- Theme 5: Trust and effectiveness can diverge (the exceptions)
- They are COMPLEMENTARY, not contradictory
- Theme 5 shows the mechanism isn't absolute—there are edge cases

**Decision:** KEEP both. Theme 5 is the "exceptions to the rule" that make Theme 4 more nuanced.

### Hidden Meaning Split Check

**Question:** Is there a second meaning hiding?

**Found:** Two distinct divergence patterns:
1. **Trusted but ineffective** (friends, kind coaches) — relates to HUMAN support
2. **Effective but not trusted** (AI templates, rejected frameworks) — relates to AI and bad coaches

These are TWO DIRECTIONS of divergence. Both fit the same organizing idea (trust ≠ effectiveness).

**Decision:** KEEP as single theme with bidirectional sub-themes.

### Refinement Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| KEEP | Theme 5 as exceptions/edge cases to Theme 4 |
| CLARIFY | Two directions: Trusted→Ineffective, Effective→Untrusted |
| ADD | Discussion of TASK TYPE as moderator (emotional tasks need trust; bounded tasks don't) |
| POSITION | As complement to Theme 4, not contradiction |

---

## Theme 6: The Hybrid Ideal — Sequencing Support

### Coherence Check: Are all extracts "about the same thing"?

| Extract | Speaker | Core Content | Fits Theme? | Issue? |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| "Week one, AI helps you map options... Then you meet a human coach... Then AI helps you build scenarios..." | Laura #2 | Sequenced workflow | ✓ YES | None |
| "I used AI to clarify what I want to ask... Then in the meeting, I was clear. She responded better" | Amir | AI enables human conversation | ✓ YES | None |
| "At the beginning, I needed relational safety... AI could not give me that. Once I had momentum, AI could support" | Katharina | Timing matters | ✓ YES | None |
| "Humans get tired if you are messy... But if you say, I have three paths, here is what I value... then the conversation is productive" | Laura #2 | AI reduces messiness | ✓ YES | None |
| "I would use AI to organize my thoughts, then the human would help contextualize and challenge me" | Tobias | Division of labor | ✓ YES | Overlap with Theme 3? |
| "AI first... Then human: 45 minutes to decide my positioning... and maybe a short follow-up" | Daniel | Sequencing | ✓ YES | None |

**Verdict:** All extracts cohere around combining AI and human support with attention to sequencing.

### Internal Consistency Check

**Question:** Is this duplicating Theme 3 (Complementary Competencies)?

**Analysis:**
- Theme 3: WHAT each is good for (capabilities)
- Theme 6: HOW to combine them (workflow, sequencing, timing)
- The Tobias extract could fit either—it describes division of labor (Theme 3) but also workflow (Theme 6)

**Decision:** Move "division of labor" extracts that focus on WHAT to Theme 3. Keep "sequencing/timing" extracts in Theme 6.

**Specific move:** Tobias's extract stays in Theme 6 because it describes a process ("I would... then...")

### Hidden Meaning Split Check

**Question:** Is there a second meaning hiding?

**Found:** Two aspects:
1. **The preference itself** (universal hybrid preference)
2. **The requirements for hybrid** (trust, boundaries, quality control)

The requirements (Cluster J) are different from the preference (Cluster I). They're about CONDITIONS for trusting a hybrid system.

**Decision:** SPLIT Cluster J into Theme 6 sub-theme on "Trust Requirements for Hybrid Models"

### Refinement Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| KEEP | Theme 6 focused on workflow/sequencing |
| CLARIFY | Boundary with Theme 3: This is HOW (workflow), that is WHAT (capabilities) |
| ADD | Sub-theme 6f: Trust requirements for hybrid platforms |
| EMPHASIZE | Universal preference (18/19) as key finding |

# LEVEL 2: DATASET-LEVEL REVIEW

## Re-reading Transcripts with Themes in Mind

### Coverage Check: Important Chunks Not Covered?

| Area | Covered? | By Which Theme? | Gap Action |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| What builds human trust | ✓ | Theme 1 | - |
| What breaks human trust | ✓ | Theme 1 | - |
| AI non-judgment safety | ✓ | Theme 2 | - |
| AI limitations | Partial | Theme 2, 3 | Add to Theme 3 |
| What AI is good for | ✓ | Theme 3 | - |
| What humans are good for | ✓ | Theme 3 | - |
| Trust-effectiveness mechanism | ✓ | Theme 4 | - |
| Trust-effectiveness exceptions | ✓ | Theme 5 | - |
| Hybrid preferences | ✓ | Theme 6 | - |
| **Immigrant/visa context** | ✗ NOT A THEME | Contextual layer | Keep as context, not theme |
| **Cost/access barriers** | Partial | Theme 6 | Add as driver of hybrid |
| **AI for emotional processing** | Partial | Theme 2, 3 | Clarify AI for venting |
| **Same words, different impact** | ✓ | Theme 1 | - |
| **Somatic trust experience** | Partial | Theme 1 | Add sub-theme |

### Contradiction Check: Are We Ignoring Contradictions?

| Apparent Contradiction | Resolution | Implication |
|------------------------|------------|-------------|
| "Trust is gateway" vs "Can be effective without trust" | Theme 4 is the rule, Theme 5 is the exceptions. Task type moderates. | Both are true—depends on task |
| "AI is safe" vs "AI is limited" | Different dimensions: emotional safety vs epistemic accuracy | Not contradiction, different aspects |
| "Humans are better" vs "AI is better" | Neither is globally better—depends on task | Theme 3's point exactly |
| "Friends are trusted" vs "Friends are not effective" | Trust ≠ Effectiveness (Theme 5's point) | Not contradiction, the finding |
| "AI overconfidence is bad" vs "AI confidence is useful" | Context: bad for facts, useful for encouragement | Add nuance to Theme 2/3 |

### Negative Cases: Does Anyone Say the Opposite?

| Theme | Negative Case? | Participant | Content | Resolution |
|-------|----------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| 1. Human Trust Architecture | NONE | - | No one says trust doesn't require these components | Strong support |
| 2. AI Non-Judgment Safety | PARTIAL | Jonas | High AI comfort, less emphasis on "safety" framing | He uses AI sophisticatedly; safety is implicit |
| 3. Complementary Competencies | NONE | - | Universal agreement on different strengths | Strong support |
| 4. Trust as Gateway | PARTIAL | Laura #2 | Very high AI effectiveness (9) with moderate trust (7.5) | Shows mechanism is stronger for humans than AI |
| 5. Trust-Effectiveness Divergence | NONE | - | Multiple examples support this | Strong support |
| 6. Hybrid Ideal | NONE | - | 18/19 explicitly prefer hybrid | Very strong support |

**Most Important Negative Case:**

**Laura #2's High AI Effectiveness Despite Moderate Trust**

- AI Trust: 7.5/10
- AI Effectiveness: 9/10
- Gap: +1.5 points (effectiveness exceeds trust)

**Analysis:** This is not a contradiction to Theme 4 (Trust as Gateway). It shows:
1. The mechanism operates DIFFERENTLY for AI vs humans
2. For AI, you can get effectiveness without deep trust because tasks are bounded
3. Laura #2 didn't share sensitive details with AI—she used it for structure, not for emotional disclosure

**Implication:** Add qualifier to Theme 4: "The gateway mechanism is strongest for human coaching, where deep disclosure is possible. For AI, bounded effectiveness can occur with partial trust because tasks don't require emotional vulnerability."

# EDGE CASES AND CONTRADICTIONS LIST

## Edge Cases (Gold for Discussion)

### Edge Case 1: Amir's Sophisticated AI Use

**Description:** Amir (24, Iranian, UX student in Cologne) uses AI with custom prompts 3-4x weekly for structured reflection, rating AI trust at 8/10 and effectiveness at 8/10—the highest in the dataset.

**Why It's an Edge Case:**
- Most participants use AI more casually
- His intentional design (prompt templates, decision logs) is unusual
- His ratings suggest AI CAN achieve high trust/effectiveness with sophisticated use

**Resolution:**
- Not a contradiction—shows the CEILING of what's possible
- He still prefers humans for "pivotal moments"
- Supports Theme 3 (AI is good for structured reflection) and Theme 6 (hybrid is ideal)

**Discussion Value:** What happens when users design their AI interactions intentionally? Can AI trust/effectiveness increase with deliberate practice?

---

### Edge Case 2: Tobias's Trust Rupture → AI Refuge

**Description:** Tobias (28, German engineer in Stuttgart) had trust destroyed by a bad coach (rated human trust 4/10, effectiveness 2/10). He then turned to AI as a refuge (7/10, 6/10).

**Why It's an Edge Case:**
- One bad experience created lasting coaching aversion
- AI became his primary support because it can't shame him
- He later built a trusting informal mentorship

**Resolution:**
- Strongly supports Theme 1 (trust rupture is rapid and lasting)
- Strongly supports Theme 2 (AI as judgment-free zone)
- Shows recovery IS possible (informal mentor), but formal coaching may be permanently damaged

**Discussion Value:** How should coaching profession handle trust violations? What's the role of AI for people with coaching trauma?

---

### Edge Case 3: Laura #2's AI-Driven Decision

**Description:** Laura #2 (27, Spanish analyst in Frankfurt) used AI intensively for 3 weeks to make a major career decision (leaving banking for climate startup), rating AI effectiveness at 9/10.

**Why It's an Edge Case:**
- Highest AI effectiveness rating in dataset
- Made a life-changing decision with AI as "backbone"
- Challenges assumption that big decisions need human support

**Resolution:**
- She ALSO used humans (sister, friends, colleague)—it was hybrid
- AI provided structure; humans provided emotional support and reality check
- The 9/10 reflects what AI DID (structure), not what it replaced

**Discussion Value:** Can AI facilitate major decisions? What does "AI-driven" really mean when examined closely?

---

### Edge Case 4: "Everyone Feels That" — Same Words, Different Impact

**Description:** Tobias's coach said "everyone feels that" dismissively, destroying trust. Later, his mentor said similar words ("everyone has this") with empathy, building trust.

**Why It's an Edge Case:**
- Identical content, opposite outcomes
- Challenges the idea that trust depends on WHAT is said
- Shows delivery/tone is primary

**Resolution:**
- Strongly supports Theme 1's "challenge without shame" sub-theme
- The SAME challenge can build or break trust depending on HOW it's delivered
- Dismissal = "shut up"; Connection = "you're not alone"

**Discussion Value:** What specific delivery factors distinguish challenge from shame? Can this be taught?

---

### Edge Case 5: Cultural Safety for Immigrants

**Description:** Multiple immigrants (Amir, Daniel, Simon, Laura #1, Laura #2) describe AI as particularly safe because they don't need to perform capability for a judge who may have biases.

**Why It's an Edge Case:**
- Suggests AI may have SPECIAL value for certain populations
- Raises equity questions about human coaching
- Points to human bias that AI avoids

**Resolution:**
- Supports Theme 2's cultural safety sub-theme
- Doesn't mean AI is "better" for immigrants—they still prefer hybrid
- Highlights that human coaching may have bias barriers AI doesn't

**Discussion Value:** Does AI democratize access to non-judgmental support? What are the equity implications?

---

## Contradictions (Real or Apparent)

### Contradiction 1: Trust as Necessary vs Trust as Not Necessary

**Apparent Conflict:**
- Theme 4 says trust is gateway to effectiveness
- Theme 5 says effectiveness can occur without trust

**Resolution:** NOT a real contradiction. Task type moderates:
- For EMOTIONAL/IDENTITY tasks: Trust is necessary (Theme 4 applies)
- For BOUNDED/COGNITIVE tasks: Trust is helpful but not essential (Theme 5 shows exceptions)
- The level of VULNERABILITY required determines whether trust is a gate or a filter

**Implication for Analysis:** Explicitly state the moderating role of task type.

---

### Contradiction 2: AI is Safe vs AI is Limited

**Apparent Conflict:**
- Theme 2 says AI provides safety
- Theme 3 says AI is limited (hallucinations, lacks context)

**Resolution:** NOT a contradiction—different DIMENSIONS:
- Safety = emotional/psychological (Theme 2)
- Limitations = epistemic/cognitive (Theme 3)
- AI can be emotionally safe while epistemically unreliable

**Implication for Analysis:** Distinguish emotional trust from epistemic trust.

---

### Contradiction 3: Universal Hybrid Preference vs Different Individual Patterns

**Apparent Conflict:**
- Theme 6 says everyone prefers hybrid
- But some participants (Amir) use AI heavily; others (Katharina) use humans heavily

**Resolution:** "Hybrid preference" doesn't mean 50/50 split:
- All 19 want SOME combination
- The MIX varies by person, context, access
- Preference for hybrid ≠ equal use of both

**Implication for Analysis:** Hybrid is about combination, not balance.

---

### Contradiction 4: Trust Takes Time vs Trust Forms Quickly

**Apparent Conflict:**
- Some say trust takes time (Amir: "one session, there is no trust built")
- Katharina says trust formed quickly when coach asked safety questions

**Resolution:** NOT a contradiction—different CONDITIONS:
- Trust CAN form quickly when specific behaviors occur (explicit safety, being seen)
- Trust takes time when those behaviors are absent
- Rupture is always fast; building can be fast or slow

**Implication for Analysis:** Trust building speed depends on coach behavior, not just time.

---

## Summary: Refinements Made

| Theme | Refinement |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Added sub-theme on somatic trust; clarified builders/breakers as sub-themes |
