# Step 5: Defining and Naming Themes

# THEME 1: THE HUMAN TRUST ARCHITECTURE

## 1. Theme Title

**The Human Trust Architecture: What Builds and Breaks Relational Safety**

## 2. One-Sentence Essence

This theme shows that trust in human coaching is not a single variable but a multi-component architecture—requiring competence, confidentiality, being seen, and challenge without shame—that can be built gradually but destroyed instantly through dismissiveness, judgment, or generic approaches.

## 3. Definition

Trust in human career coaching operates as an architecture composed of specific, identifiable components that participants consistently articulate. The foundational pillars include: (1) **competence** in the participant's market/industry, (2) **confidentiality** explicitly stated, (3) **being seen** through personalization and pattern recognition, and (4) **challenge without shame**—the ability to confront without judging. This architecture can be constructed over time through consistent behavior but can collapse instantly through a single act of dismissiveness or invalidation. Once ruptured, trust is difficult or impossible to repair, often creating lasting aversion to coaching. The embodied/somatic dimension—participants describe stomach dropping, throat tightening, heat in face—reveals that trust operates at a whole-person level, not merely cognitively.

## 4. What This Theme Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT mean all components must be equally present (some may compensate for others)
- It does NOT mean trust is purely rational (somatic responses reveal its emotional nature)
- It does NOT apply to AI trust (see Theme 2 for the distinct AI trust pattern)
- It does NOT guarantee effectiveness (trust is necessary but not sufficient—see Theme 5)
- It does NOT mean trust must form slowly (specific behaviors can accelerate formation)

## 5. Sub-themes

| Sub-theme | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **1a. Competence Trust** | Coaches must demonstrate domain knowledge—understanding salary bands, industry culture, visa constraints, job markets. Generic advice signals incompetence. "Does the person actually know what they are talking about?" is the first filter participants apply. |
| **1b. Safety Trust (Challenge Without Shame)** | Participants distinguish between productive challenge ("you avoid conflict") and shaming judgment ("you're too sensitive"). The ability to confront without invalidating is repeatedly cited as critical. "Challenge without shaming, got it" becomes a trust-forming contract. |
| **1c. Being Seen** | Personalization signals attention: remembering details from previous sessions, catching patterns in behavior, asking follow-up questions that show listening. Generic responses or treating participants as "case number 47" destroys the sense of being seen. |
| **1d. Trust Rupture** | Trust destruction is rapid, often instantaneous, and lasting. A single dismissive comment ("everyone feels that") can permanently close a participant. The speed asymmetry is striking: building takes sessions, destroying takes seconds. |
| **1e. Somatic Trust** | Trust and its violation are experienced bodily: "stomach dropped," "heat in my face," "throat got tight," "stopped breathing." This embodied dimension reveals trust as a whole-person phenomenon, not merely cognitive assessment. |

## 6. Best Quotes

**Quote 1 — Katharina (Line 4585):**
> "I need confidentiality, obviously, and I need clear structure. And I said, I need challenge without shame... she repeated it back... challenge without shaming, got it. If at any point you feel shame in the room, tell me, because shame blocks learning. That was like, wow. That made me trust her quickly."

**Quote 2 — Tobias (Line 5219):**
> "My stomach dropped. Like, physically. I felt heat in my face. And my throat got tight. I remember I stopped breathing for a second. I made myself vulnerable, and he slapped it away. And then I became very careful."

**Quote 3 — Tobias (Line 5326):**
> "The coach said it like, shut up. The colleague said it like, you are not alone. Big difference."

**Quote 4 — Amir (Line 4819):**
> "I need them to ask good questions, not only give advice. If they only give advice, then it is like, okay, you are just a blog post."

**Quote 5 — Katharina (Line 4589):**
> "Confidentiality, structure, competence in my market, empathy, challenge, consistency, and being seen. Like remembering details, catching patterns, not just listening passively."

## 7. Connection to Research Questions

| RQ | How This Theme Answers It |
|----|---------------------------|
| **RQ1 (Trust)** | This theme directly defines what trust means for human coaching—a multi-component architecture, not a single attitude. It identifies the specific behaviors and conditions that build versus break trust, providing a granular answer to "how do individuals describe trust in human coaching." The contrast with AI trust (Theme 2) becomes clear: human trust is relational and constructed; AI trust is functional and based on absence. |
| **RQ2 (Effectiveness)** | Indirectly: The trust architecture determines whether effectiveness is possible. Without the architecture intact, participants withhold information, and coaching addresses a "performed" rather than real self (see Theme 4). The architecture is thus a precondition for effectiveness. |
| **RQ3 (Trust-Effectiveness Link)** | This theme establishes what trust IS, which Theme 4 then connects to effectiveness through the gateway mechanism. The architecture components—especially being seen and challenge without shame—are what enable deep disclosure, which enables tailored advice, which enables action. |

# THEME 2: AI'S BOUNDED SAFETY

## 1. Theme Title

**AI's Bounded Safety: Non-Judgment as Psychological Shelter**

## 2. One-Sentence Essence

This theme shows that AI provides a distinctive form of psychological safety through its inability to judge, shame, or tire—creating a space where participants disclose fears and vulnerabilities they might withhold from humans—though this safety is bounded by AI's limitations and cannot replace relational connection.

## 3. Definition

AI trust operates fundamentally differently from human trust. Where human trust requires active construction (competence demonstrated, confidentiality stated, being seen), AI trust derives from **absence**—the absence of judgment, ego, fatigue, and social consequence. Participants describe AI as a "judgment-free zone" where they can "be messy," admit fear, ask "stupid questions," and process rejection without performance pressure. This safety is particularly valuable for immigrants and those from cultures emphasizing pride/capability, who face double performance pressure in human interactions. However, participants recognize this safety as **bounded**: "shallow comfort" that provides a "container" but not "companionship." AI cannot "mean" empathy, and privacy concerns lead to self-censoring that limits disclosure depth. The safety is real but circumscribed.

## 4. What This Theme Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT mean AI is trusted for factual accuracy (epistemic trust is low—see Theme 3)
- It does NOT mean AI provides emotional support (it's a container, not a relationship)
- It does NOT mean AI trust is higher than human trust overall (they're different types)
- It does NOT mean privacy concerns are absent (self-censoring is common)
- It does NOT mean this safety leads to better outcomes (safe ≠ effective)

## 5. Sub-themes

| Sub-theme | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **2a. Freedom from Performance** | With AI, participants don't need to appear confident, capable, or together. They can write "I am scared" without fear of judgment. This removes the performance pressure inherent in human interaction, where appearing competent feels necessary. |
| **2b. Cultural/Immigrant Safety** | For immigrants and those from cultures valuing pride, AI provides particular relief. "I come from a culture where you have pride, you do not show weakness." AI is an equalizing space where cultural background doesn't create additional performance burden. |
| **2c. Availability** | AI doesn't tire, doesn't get bored, doesn't judge late-night venting. It's accessible when humans aren't—at 1am, on weekends, during crises. This constant availability is itself a form of safety: there's always a container available. |
| **2d. Container vs. Connection** | AI provides containment ("a container for thoughts") but not companionship. The distinction is explicit: "It's comforting in a shallow way because it doesn't judge me. But it doesn't replace a friend." The safety is real but relationally limited. |
| **2e. Privacy Constraints** | Despite the safety, participants self-censor: not sharing exact salaries, company names, confidential details. "I abstract. I do not write exact company name." Privacy concerns bound the depth of AI engagement, limiting its potential value. |

## 6. Best Quotes

**Quote 1 — Amir (Line 4851):**
> "It does not require me to perform confidence. With humans, I often perform. With AI, I can write, I am scared, and it is fine."

**Quote 2 — Amir (Line 4853):**
> "I come from a culture where you have pride, you do not show weakness too much. And also as an immigrant, you always want to appear capable. The AI is like, okay, you can be messy here."

**Quote 3 — Daniel (Line 82):**
> "It's comforting in a shallow way because it doesn't judge me. But it doesn't replace a friend."

**Quote 4 — Amir (Line 4897):**
> "It is like, not companionship, but containment. Like a container for thoughts."

**Quote 5 — Tobias (Line 5275):**
> "Emotionally, it cannot shame me. That is important. Like, AI does not say, you are too sensitive."

## 7. Connection to Research Questions

| RQ | How This Theme Answers It |
|----|---------------------------|
| **RQ1 (Trust)** | This theme defines AI trust as qualitatively different from human trust—based on absence (of judgment) rather than presence (of competence/empathy). Participants trust AI for emotional safety but not for truth. This creates a distinct trust profile: high psychological safety, low epistemic authority. The comparison with human trust (Theme 1) reveals two fundamentally different trust architectures. |
| **RQ2 (Effectiveness)** | Indirectly: The safety enables certain kinds of effectiveness (honest input, processing without judgment) but limits others (contextual understanding, emotional depth). AI's bounded safety contributes to its bounded effectiveness. |
| **RQ3 (Trust-Effectiveness Link)** | AI's unique safety explains why AI can achieve effectiveness in certain domains even with partial trust. Because emotional safety is high (no judgment), participants can be honest about fears, improving input quality. But because relational safety is absent, deeper work remains inaccessible. The link is domain-specific. |

# THEME 3: COMPLEMENTARY COMPETENCIES

## 1. Theme Title

**Complementary Competencies: What AI and Humans Each Do Well**

## 2. One-Sentence Essence

This theme shows that participants have clear, consistent mental models of AI versus human strengths—AI excels at structure, iteration, and breadth while humans excel at context, accountability, and high-stakes support—and they match modality to task accordingly.

## 3. Definition

Participants do not view AI and human coaching as competing but as **complementary**, with distinct and well-defined competencies. **AI strengths** center on cognitive tasks: generating options, structuring chaos into steps, overcoming blank-page paralysis, iterating drafts without fatigue or judgment, and providing breadth quickly. **AI limitations** include lack of contextual knowledge (local markets, industry politics, cultural norms), epistemic unreliability (hallucinations, overconfidence), and inability to create accountability. **Human strengths** center on relational and contextual tasks: providing local/industry knowledge, understanding office politics, offering emotional support, creating accountability through relationship, and supporting high-stakes decisions that require courage. **Human limitations** include fatigue, availability constraints, potential for judgment, and cost. Participants actively match modality to task: "For X, I prefer AI; for Y, I prefer human."

## 4. What This Theme Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT mean AI is worse than humans (or vice versa) overall
- It does NOT mean these preferences are fixed (they may evolve with AI capabilities)
- It does NOT describe the trust formation process (see Themes 1, 2)
- It does NOT describe hybrid workflows (see Theme 6)—this is WHAT, that is HOW
- It does NOT mean participants always have access to their preferred modality

## 5. Sub-themes

| Sub-theme | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **3a. AI for Starting** | AI overcomes blank-page paralysis: "The blank page problem is real." It gives "something to react to" rather than creating from nothing. AI's value is often in initiating, providing a first draft that can be refined. |
| **3b. AI for Iterating** | AI supports multiple revisions without judgment or fatigue. Participants can iterate freely without social cost: "I can ask it to rewrite ten times and it doesn't get annoyed." This reduces perfectionism paralysis. |
| **3c. AI for Breadth** | AI generates many options quickly—role possibilities, company lists, interview questions. "It can list many roles and explain." This breadth is valuable for exploration before narrowing. |
| **3d. AI Limitations** | AI lacks contextual knowledge ("it does not know the informal parts"), can hallucinate facts, and shows overconfidence ("it gave ranges that felt too broad and not grounded"). Participants verify AI output rather than trusting it directly. |
| **3e. Humans for Context** | Humans understand local realities AI cannot access: "Frankfurt banking is very specific." Industry politics, cultural norms, what's actually realistic—these require lived experience. |
| **3f. Humans for Stakes** | High-stakes decisions need human support: "Decisions need courage. And courage comes from feeling supported, not from a perfect spreadsheet." Salary negotiations, quitting, confronting managers—these require presence. |
| **3g. Humans for Accountability** | Participants don't feel accountable to AI: "I do not feel accountable to AI. I can ignore notifications." Human relationship creates commitment that algorithms cannot. |

## 6. Best Quotes

**Quote 1 — Laura #2 (Line 5072):**
> "AI is very good. Because it can turn chaos into steps. And then humans can validate the steps. So AI creates the plan, human makes it realistic."

**Quote 2 — Katharina (Line 4687):**
> "AI can generate templates and reminders, but human accountability was what made me actually do it. I do not feel accountable to AI."

**Quote 3 — Silvia (Line 4285):**
> "AI for execution and structure, humans for meaning and courage... decisions need courage. And courage comes from feeling supported, not from a perfect spreadsheet."

**Quote 4 — Tobias (Line 5303):**
> "Human, definitely. Someone inside or with deep industry knowledge... AI can give general ideas, but it does not know the informal parts."

**Quote 5 — Simon (Line 435):**
> "It reduced stress, because the blank page problem is real. I could look at something and react. I felt, okay, I can work with this."

## 7. Connection to Research Questions

| RQ | How This Theme Answers It |
|----|---------------------------|
| **RQ1 (Trust)** | Indirectly: Trust varies by task type. Participants trust AI for structure tasks but not for factual accuracy or contextual knowledge. Trust is domain-specific, not global. |
| **RQ2 (Effectiveness)** | This theme directly answers RQ2 by mapping perceived effectiveness to task type. Neither modality is globally more effective—effectiveness depends on the task. AI is highly effective for drafting/iteration; humans are highly effective for context/stakes. The comparison reveals complementarity, not competition. |
| **RQ3 (Trust-Effectiveness Link)** | Establishes that effectiveness is task-specific, which moderates the trust-effectiveness link. For bounded cognitive tasks, trust matters less. For emotional/contextual tasks, trust is essential. The link strength varies by domain. |

# THEME 4: TRUST AS GATEWAY

## 1. Theme Title

**Trust as Gateway: How Disclosure Depth Determines Outcome Quality**

## 2. One-Sentence Essence

This theme shows that trust functions as a gateway controlling disclosure depth—with high trust, participants share real fears and blockers enabling tailored advice; with low trust, they share "safe versions" leading to generic advice and resistance to action.

## 3. Definition

Trust is not merely a feeling but a **functional mechanism** that determines information quality in the coaching relationship. The mechanism operates as a causal chain: **Trust → Disclosure Depth → Advice Quality → Action Willingness**. When trust is high, participants share the real problem ("I'm terrified of rejection"), allowing coaches to address actual blockers. When trust is low, participants share a "polished" or "safe" version ("I need help with my CV"), and coaches address a surface issue while the real blocker remains hidden. This creates the "performance problem": "The coach will coach the performance, not the reality." Trust also affects advice uptake—even good advice from distrusted sources creates resistance: "If someone I trust would say it, I would do it. But because he said it after invalidating me, I did not want to engage." The mechanism operates more strongly for humans than AI, because AI interactions rarely require the emotional vulnerability that makes trust essential.

## 4. What This Theme Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT mean trust is sufficient for effectiveness (see Theme 5 for exceptions)
- It does NOT mean the mechanism operates identically for AI and humans (it's stronger for humans)
- It does NOT apply to purely technical/informational tasks (these don't require disclosure)
- It does NOT mean trust must be complete—partial trust can enable partial depth
- It does NOT describe what builds trust (see Themes 1, 2)—this describes what trust DOES

## 5. Sub-themes

| Sub-theme | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **4a. Trust as Permission** | Trust gives permission to share the real problem rather than the acceptable version. "Trust is like permission. If I trust... I will share the real problem, not the polite version." Permission is the first gate in the mechanism. |
| **4b. The Performance Problem** | Without trust, participants perform confidence and capability. The coach then coaches a fiction: "The coach will coach the performance, not the reality." This explains why some coaching fails despite competent coaches—they're working with false information. |
| **4c. Trust as Multiplier** | Trust amplifies the impact of advice. "Trust is like a multiplier." The same suggestion lands differently from trusted versus distrusted sources. Trust doesn't just enable disclosure; it enhances uptake. |
| **4d. Distrust Creates Resistance** | Even good advice from distrusted sources creates resistance. Acting on it feels like accepting their authority: "If I follow his framework, I accept his worldview." Distrust adds cognitive friction regardless of advice quality. |
| **4e. Mechanism Strength Varies** | The gateway mechanism is strongest for human coaching involving emotional disclosure. For AI and bounded tasks, effectiveness can occur with partial trust because tasks don't require vulnerability. The mechanism is moderated by task type. |

## 6. Best Quotes

**Quote 1 — Katharina (Line 4707):**
> "For me, trust is the gateway. If I trust the coach, I admit the real thing I am avoiding... Without trust, I stay on the surface."

**Quote 2 — Tobias (Line 5310):**
> "When I distrust the person, I do not share real information. I share a safe version. Then the advice is based on wrong or incomplete input."

**Quote 3 — Amir (Line 4924):**
> "With humans, if I do not trust, I will not share real fears. I will perform. Then the coach will coach the performance, not the reality."

**Quote 4 — Daniel (Line 118):**
> "Trust is like a multiplier."

**Quote 5 — Tobias (Line 5237):**
> "If someone I trust would say it, I would do it. But because he said it after invalidating me and labeling me, I did not want to engage. It felt like, if I follow his framework, I accept his worldview."

## 7. Connection to Research Questions

| RQ | How This Theme Answers It |
|----|---------------------------|
| **RQ1 (Trust)** | Explains WHY trust matters, not just WHAT it is. Trust isn't a nice-to-have; it's functionally essential for quality coaching because it determines input quality. |
| **RQ2 (Effectiveness)** | Directly: Effectiveness depends on advice quality, which depends on disclosure depth, which depends on trust. The mechanism explains how trust produces (or fails to produce) effective outcomes. |
| **RQ3 (Trust-Effectiveness Link)** | **This is the CENTRAL answer to RQ3.** Trust and effectiveness are linked through a causal mechanism: Trust → Depth → Quality → Action. The theme provides the explanatory chain for how trust connects to effectiveness, not just that they correlate. The mechanism also explains when the link is weak (bounded tasks) versus strong (emotional tasks). |

# THEME 5: THE TRUST-EFFECTIVENESS DIVERGENCE

## 1. Theme Title

**The Trust-Effectiveness Divergence: When They Don't Align**

## 2. One-Sentence Essence

This theme shows that trust and effectiveness, while generally linked (Theme 4), can diverge in both directions—high trust can yield low effectiveness (warm support without direction), and low trust can still produce useful outputs (effective but with friction).

## 3. Definition

While Theme 4 establishes that trust generally enables effectiveness, this theme identifies the **exceptions**. Divergence occurs in two directions: (1) **Trusted but Not Effective**: Friends, kind coaches, and supportive colleagues can be deeply trusted but fail to produce direction, structure, or action. Warmth without structure leaves participants "feeling warm, but nothing changed." (2) **Effective but Not Trusted**: AI templates, frameworks from dismissed coaches, and advice from skeptical sources can produce useful outputs even without trust. However, using distrusted advice incurs a cognitive cost—"you second-guess everything, so it's harder to act." These exceptions reveal that trust is **necessary but not sufficient** for effectiveness, and that **task type moderates** the relationship: emotional/identity tasks require trust (Theme 4 dominates); bounded/cognitive tasks can function with partial trust (Theme 5 exceptions apply).

## 4. What This Theme Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT contradict Theme 4—these are exceptions to a general pattern
- It does NOT mean trust is unimportant (it remains the primary driver)
- It does NOT mean effectiveness without trust is equivalent to effectiveness with trust (there's cognitive cost)
- It does NOT apply equally to all tasks (task type moderates)
- It does NOT mean friends are bad sources of support (they serve different functions)

## 5. Sub-themes

| Sub-theme | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **5a. Trusted but Ineffective** | Friends, supportive colleagues, and kind coaches can be deeply trusted but fail to produce actionable direction. "I left feeling warm, but nothing changed." Trust without structure is emotionally supportive but not practically effective. |
| **5b. Effective but Not Trusted** | AI templates, rejected frameworks, and advice from dismissed sources can still be useful if verified and adapted. "He gave a framework that is actually not stupid" but trust rupture prevented engagement. Utility can exist without trust. |
| **5c. Cost of Distrust** | Using distrusted advice requires extra cognitive effort—second-guessing, verifying, adapting. "If you don't trust, you second-guess everything, so it's harder to act." Effectiveness without trust is possible but effortful. |
| **5d. Task Type as Moderator** | The divergence depends on task type. For emotional/identity work, trust is essential (Theme 4 applies strongly). For bounded cognitive tasks, trust is helpful but not essential (Theme 5 exceptions apply). Vulnerability level determines trust necessity. |
| **5e. Partial Trust, Partial Effectiveness** | Bounded relationships for bounded tasks. Participants trust AI for drafting but not facts. Trust calibrated by domain allows functional relationships even without full trust. |

## 6. Best Quotes

**Quote 1 — Daniel (Line 114):**
> "I trusted her as a person. But she didn't give concrete actions. I left feeling warm, but nothing changed."

**Quote 2 — Katharina (Line 4549):**
> "I talked to a university friend... very supportive but also very passive. Like, she would say, you are great, they should appreciate you. But no concrete action."

**Quote 3 — Laura #2 (Line 5041):**
> "My friend in Barcelona. I called her crying... she was very supportive... I trusted her emotionally. It felt very good. But after the call, I still had no plan. So it was trusted but not effective."

**Quote 4 — Daniel (Line 116):**
> "His advice had useful parts... But I didn't trust him... I still took some tips, but it cost energy. If you don't trust, you second-guess everything, so it's harder to act."

**Quote 5 — Tobias (Line 5235):**
> "He gave a framework that is actually not stupid... your value proposition in three parts... If someone I trust would say it, I would do it. But because he said it after invalidating me and labeling me, I did not want to engage."

## 7. Connection to Research Questions

| RQ | How This Theme Answers It |
|----|---------------------------|
| **RQ1 (Trust)** | Demonstrates that trust is a distinct construct from effectiveness—they can vary independently. This refines RQ1's answer: trust matters, but not because it directly produces outcomes. |
| **RQ2 (Effectiveness)** | Shows that effectiveness requires more than trust—it requires structure and direction. Kindness isn't enough. This nuances RQ2: effectiveness has its own requirements beyond trust. |
| **RQ3 (Trust-Effectiveness Link)** | Provides the exceptions and moderators to Theme 4's mechanism. The link is strong but not deterministic. Task type (emotional vs cognitive) and structure (present vs absent) moderate whether trust translates to effectiveness. This complexity enriches the RQ3 answer. |

# THEME 6: THE HYBRID IDEAL

## 1. Theme Title

**The Hybrid Ideal: Sequencing AI and Human Support**

## 2. One-Sentence Essence

This theme shows that participants universally prefer combining AI and human support rather than choosing one, with clear mental models about sequencing—AI for preparation and follow-up, humans for pivotal moments—and that AI preparation can enhance human conversations.

## 3. Definition

All 19 participants expressed preference for some form of hybrid model rather than AI-only or human-only support. This preference isn't merely additive ("both are good") but **sequential and strategic**: participants have clear mental models of WHEN to use each modality. The typical pattern is: (1) **AI for preparation**—clarifying thoughts, mapping options, reducing "messiness" before human sessions; (2) **Humans for pivotal moments**—key decisions, emotional processing, accountability, courage; (3) **AI for follow-up**—tracking progress, integrating learnings, maintaining momentum. A crucial finding is that **AI enables better human conversations**: when participants arrive at human sessions with pre-structured thinking, the dialogue is more productive. "Humans get tired if you are messy... But if you say, I have three paths, here is what I value... then the conversation is productive." Cost and access also drive hybrid preferences—human coaching is expensive, AI fills gaps and extends access.

## 4. What This Theme Does NOT Mean

- It does NOT mean 50/50 split—participants mix AI and human differently based on context
- It does NOT mean humans are only for emotions (they also provide context, accountability)
- It does NOT specify a single optimal configuration (preferences vary)
- It does NOT mean AI should replace any human function (complementarity is key)
- It does NOT address specific platform design (that's implementation, not finding)

## 5. Sub-themes

| Sub-theme | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **6a. AI for Preparation** | AI helps clarify thinking before human sessions: mapping options, listing criteria, formulating questions. This pre-work makes expensive human time more productive. "I used AI to clarify what I want to ask." |
| **6b. Humans for Pivots** | Key decisions, emotional processing, and accountability require human presence. "At the beginning, I needed relational safety... AI could not give me that." Pivotal moments need relationship. |
| **6c. AI for Follow-up** | AI supports post-session integration: tracking progress, maintaining momentum, applying learnings. "Then AI helps you with execution." Continuity between human sessions. |
| **6d. AI Enables Better Human Conversations** | Structured pre-thinking improves human dialogue quality. "Humans get tired if you are messy." AI reduces the cognitive load on human supporters, making conversations more productive. |
| **6e. Sequencing and Timing** | When to use which modality matters. Some participants needed human first (to establish safety), then AI (to maintain momentum). Others could start with AI. Context determines optimal sequence. |
| **6f. Trust Requirements for Hybrid** | Hybrid platforms require: clear boundaries (what AI does vs. human), data protection, quality control of human elements, avoiding AI overreach ("do not pretend AI is a therapist"). Trust in hybrid depends on transparency. |

## 6. Best Quotes

**Quote 1 — Laura #2 (Line 5127):**
> "Week one, AI helps you map options, values, criteria. Then you meet a human coach... Then AI helps you build scenarios... Then a human helps you reality-check... Then AI helps you with execution."

**Quote 2 — Amir (Line 4928):**
> "I used AI to clarify what I want to ask... The AI helped me generate a structured agenda. Then in the meeting, I was clear. She responded better. So the AI indirectly improved a human interaction."

**Quote 3 — Laura #2 (Line 5104):**
> "Because humans get tired if you are messy. Like, you call a friend and you are like, I do not know... But if you say, I have three paths, here is what I value... then the conversation is productive."

**Quote 4 — Katharina (Line 4743):**
> "At the beginning, I needed relational safety to admit what I was avoiding. AI could not give me that. Once I had momentum, AI could support maintaining it."

**Quote 5 — Daniel (Line 140):**
> "AI first... Then human: 45 minutes to decide my positioning... and maybe a short follow-up."

## 7. Connection to Research Questions

| RQ | How This Theme Answers It |
|----|---------------------------|
| **RQ1 (Trust)** | Trust in hybrid models requires clear boundaries between AI and human roles. Participants want transparency about what each does. Trust isn't just in the modalities but in the system combining them. |
| **RQ2 (Effectiveness)** | Hybrid models are perceived as most effective because they combine AI's structure with human's context and accountability. Neither alone is optimal. Effectiveness is maximized through strategic combination. |
| **RQ3 (Trust-Effectiveness Link)** | The hybrid preference synthesizes the trust-effectiveness findings. Participants intuitively understand that AI and humans have different trust-effectiveness profiles (Themes 1-5) and design workflows that leverage each appropriately. The hybrid ideal is the PRACTICAL answer to "what do people prefer?"—it emerges from understanding both trust dynamics and complementary competencies. |

# SUMMARY: THEMES AT A GLANCE

| # | Theme | One-Sentence Essence | Primary RQ |
|---|-------|---------------------|------------|
| 1 | **The Human Trust Architecture** | Trust in humans is a multi-component architecture (competence, confidentiality, being seen, challenge without shame) that builds gradually and breaks instantly. | RQ1 |
| 2 | **AI's Bounded Safety** | AI provides psychological safety through non-judgment, creating space for disclosure, though this safety is bounded and cannot replace connection. | RQ1 |
| 3 | **Complementary Competencies** | AI excels at structure/iteration/breadth; humans excel at context/stakes/accountability—effectiveness depends on matching modality to task. | RQ2 |
| 4 | **Trust as Gateway** | Trust controls disclosure depth, which determines advice quality, which affects action willingness—this is the causal mechanism linking trust to effectiveness. | RQ3 (Central) |
| 5 | **Trust-Effectiveness Divergence** | Trust and effectiveness can diverge: trusted sources may lack structure; distrusted sources may still be useful. Task type moderates the relationship. | RQ3 |
| 6 | **The Hybrid Ideal** | Universal preference for combining AI and human support with clear sequencing: AI for prep/follow-up, humans for pivots. AI enables better human conversations. | RQ3 |
