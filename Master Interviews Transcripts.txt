Daniel


1) Opening & consent
Anna: Hi Daniel, thanks for joining. Can you hear me okay?
Daniel: Yeah, hi Anna. I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Anna: Yes, I can. Great. Before we start, just a couple of quick things. This is an interview about your experiences with career support, including human coaching and AI tools for career questions. It’s voluntary, you can skip any question, and you can stop anytime. With your permission, Im recording it to record audio for transcription. Is that okay?
Daniel: Yeah, that’s okay. As long as it’s anonymous, right?
Anna: Yes, exactly. We’ll anonymize everything and use a pseudonym like “Daniel,” and remove identifying details. Are there any topics you’d prefer not to discuss?
Daniel: I think it’s fine. Just… not too much family stuff. Career stuff is okay.
Anna: Totally. We’ll keep it to career-related experiences. If anything feels too personal, tell me and we’ll move on. I’m starting the recording now.
Daniel: Okay.
2) Participant context & career situation
Anna: To start, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you dealing with right now?
Daniel: Okay, um… I’m 24, I’m a UX/UI designer. I’m in Germany now, in Berlin. I moved here almost three years ago. And right now I’m kind of stuck in this loop of short projects and freelance gigs like three weeks here  two months there. I can’t land stable work.
Anna: When you say stable, what does that mean for you?
Daniel: Like a proper contract. Not just we’ll pay you as a freelancer, good luck. I mean full-time, or at least part-time but long-term. And honestly, stability also means health insurance not being this constant anxiety. Here it’s… a whole universe. And I’m tired of always applying, always proving myself, always rewriting case studies.
Anna: What’s been the most significant decision or moment for you in the last 6 to12 months?
Daniel: Honestly… whether I should stay in UX or pivot to something differentt. Like product, or maybe UI-only, or even something outside design. Because the junior UX market feels saturated, and also the German language requirement blocks me a lot.
Anna: How often do you see German required in roles you look at?
Daniel: A lot. Like more than half. Even if the job description is in English, they write German is a plus, but then in interviews they ask, Can you work with stakeholders in German? And I’m like… ich kann ein bisschen. But not enough for workshops.
Anna: How would you describe your German level?
Daniel: Maybe B1-ish, but not a clean B1. I can do appointments, Anmeldung, doctor stuff. But professionally, I freeze. English is fine.
Anna: And you moved from another country? Where from?
Daniel: Serbia originally. I studied there and then moved here for career and life reasons. I also had a girlfriend here at the time, but that ended. I stayed anyway.
Anna: Does your residency situation affect the job search?
Daniel: Yes and no. I have a legal residence permit tied to work, but it’s not super fragile right now. Still, employers sometimes ask, and you can feel hesitation. Even when I say, “No sponsorship,” they still look unsure. It’s just extra friction. And for me it adds pressure because I want a contract not only for money, but also for paperwork stability.
Anna: What kind of work have you been doing in your projects?
Daniel: Mostly early-stage startups. One was fintech, like a dashboard redesign. Another was e-commerce, improving checkout. And then a meditation app where it was more UI polish. Sometimes I do end-to-end research planning, interviews, journey maps, wireframes, prototyping in Figma, handoff. But in small projects it’s often like we need UI by next Friday, so you don’t do proper research, you just guess. And that bothers me.
Anna: What bothers you about it?
Daniel: Because I want to be a real UX designer, not just someone making pretty screens. I want to justify decisions, test, measure. But the projects I get are more like survival mode.
Anna: How do you usually search for work?
Daniel: LinkedIn mainly. Also company career pages. Sometimes Wellfound. In Germany I tried StepStone, but it’s very German. And I go to some meetups—UX meetups, design systems meetups. I tried portfolio reviews too.
Anna: What has networking been like for you here?
Daniel: Mixed. People are friendly at meetups, but it’s hard to convert to referrals. You talk, you connect, and then… nothing. And I’m not super outgoing. I can talk, but it costs energy.
Anna: What kind of support do you feel you need most right now?
Daniel: Clarity and strategy. Like, am I applying to the right roles? Is my portfolio wrong? Am I too generalist? Should I specialize? And also confidence. After many rejections, I start thinking I’m the problem. But I also know the market is tough. So it’s both.
3) Career support in general
Anna: When you need career support like practical or emotional then who or what do you usually turn to?
Daniel: Friends first. I have one friend who’s a developer. He’s good for keep going, but he doesn’t understand design hiring. I talk to my sister back home sometimes, but she’s like, Just get any job, which isn’t helpful hahaha. 
Anna: Yeah, my mother does the same hahaha. I understand. What about more formal support like career services, mentors, coaches?
Daniel: I tried a career service once, like an integration center thing. They helped with German CV format. Lebensrough? Basic stuff. It felt generic and more for traditional roles. And then I used ADPList, which is more design-specific.
Anna: Any other resources?
Daniel: YouTube, honestly. Portfolio tips, case study tips. Medium articles too, but it’s too much content. And sometimes I use ChatGPT for rewriting bullet points or prepping for interviews.
Anna: What tends to feel genuinely helpful?
Daniel: Something actionable. Like, change this section of your case study, or your headline is unclear, or here are keywords you’re missing.If it’s concrete, I can do it. If it’s motivational talk, it feels nice for a moment, but then I still don’t know what to do.
Anna: And what feels unhelpful?
Daniel: Advice that ignores context. Like, just network more, without understanding language barriers or how drained I am. Or just do a personal project, when I already did three and I also need money. Context-blind advice.
4) Human coaching: experience & trust
Anna: You mentioned ADPList. Can you walk me through your experience? How many sessions did you did, what you expected, and how it went overall?
Daniel: I used ADPList maybe six sessions over about a year, with different mentors. I expected portfolio feedback, career direction, maybe interview prep.
Anna: What was the experience like in most sessions?
Daniel: Most were okay. Not horrible. But not a wow. A lot were surface-level. Like they glance at the portfolio and say looks good, and then they talk about their own career a lot. And I’m sitting there thinking, okay, but what do I do tomorrow? You know?
Anna: Can you describe one session that felt neutral or disappointing what happened?
Daniel: Yeah. One mentor was a senior designer at a huge tech company. I booked him because I thought he’d know about hiring. He was clearly smart, but he was rushing. He kept checking another screen. And he kept saying, where is your impact? Where are your metrics? And I said, i was freelance, I don’t have metrics. And he was like, then create metrics. And I was like… how? I can’t invent numbers. And he said, you can approximate.That triggered a trust issue for me. I don’t want to lie.
Anna: What did that do to your trust in him?
Daniel: It dropped. I trusted his competence in big-tech storytelling, but I didn’t trust his alignment with me, and I didn’t trust the ethics of what he was suggesting. Also he didn’t ask questions about my situation, Germany, language, anything. It was like a template advice.
Anna: Was there anything about safety or confidentiality that mattered in that moment?
Daniel: Yeah, because it’s a stranger. You’re already a bit vulnerable. And when someone is distracted, you don’t feel safe to open up. So you keep it superficial.
Anna: And you said one session felt truly helpful. Can you describe that one?
Daniel: That was with a mentor who worked at a mid-size German company. She was also an immigrant, from Brazil. And I think it mattered because she understood the stress. She started by asking questions: my story, what I tried, what I want, constraints. She asked about my German level, and how I present myself in interviews. She also asked what stability means for me like contract, team, insurance. It felt structured.
Anna: What did she do that built trust for you?
Daniel: She was fully present. She took notes and told me she’s taking notes. She shared her screen and made a little structure, goal constraints strengths, gaps, actions. Then she gave feedback in a gentle way. She said my portfolio is visually strong, but the case studies read like a story without decisions. And she gave me a framework: problem, role, options considered, decision, result, reflection. Then she told me to pick two projects and rewrite them using that.
Anna: Did anything change after that session?
Daniel: Yes. I rewrote one case study. I changed my LinkedIn headline. She suggested I apply to “Product Designer” roles instead of “UX/UI Designer,” because in Germany the naming is different. She also told me to add a line like Deutsch B1 working on it instead of hiding it. That felt honest.
Anna: If you think about trust in human mentors, what are your personal trust triggers?
Daniel: Competence, empathy, structure. And humility. If someone says, i don’t know that’s fine. If they pretend, I hate it. And being fully present matters a lot.
Anna: And what makes you distrust?
Daniel: Overconfidence, generic advice, distraction. Also when mentors push their own path like it’s universal. And sometimes the power imbalance, like they treat take-home tasks as nothing, but for me it’s unpaid time I can’t afford.
5) AI tools: experience & trust
Anna: Now let’s talk about AI tools like ChatGPT. How do you use them for career-related questions?
Daniel: Mostly for rewriting. I paste bullet points and ask it to make them more concise or more impact-oriented. Sometimes I ask for keyword ideas from job descriptions. It’s like a writing assistant.
Anna: Can you give a concrete example where it helped?
Daniel: I had a bullet like designed onboarding screens for fintech app. Very flat. ChatGPT suggested stronger phrasing like redesigned onboarding flow by simplifying steps and improving clarity. It also gave me versions without fake metrics, if I ask it not to invent numbers. That helped me upgrade the tone.
Anna: And a moment where it failed or felt untrustworthy?
Daniel: One time I asked how to answer Why did you move to Germany? and it gave me this super polished, fake-sounding story about german innovation culture, and it didn’t sound like me. It also assumed a visa type incorrectly, like it just made an assumption. That reminded me that I don't know my life.
Anna: Do you have privacy concerns when using it?
Daniel: Yes. I don’t paste sensitive info. I remove company names sometimes, or I generalize. I’m cautious.
Anna: When you think about “trust” in AI, what does trust mean for you?
Daniel: Accuracy and boundaries. It should be able to say it’s unsure, but it rarely does. It always gives an answer. And I trust it more when it explains the changes, like why a sentence is stronger.
Anna: Do you ever use it for emotional support during the job search?
Daniel: Sometimes. When I get rejected I ask how to cope. It’s comforting in a shallow way because it doesn’t judge me. But it doesn’t replace a friend.
6) Human vs AI comparison via tasks
Anna: I’m going to name a few tasks, and for each one tell me whether you’d prefer a human coach, AI, or both, and why. For improving CV or LinkedIn wording?
Daniel: AI first. It’s fast, cheap, and I can iterate without feeling embarrassed. Then maybe a human to check if it sounds authentic and aligned.
Anna: For deciding what roles to apply for UX, product designer, something else?
Daniel: Human or hybrid. AI gives generic lists. A human can ask about my preferences and constraints, and also understand Germany context. But it has to be a good match.
Anna: For interview preparation?
Daniel: Hybrid. AI for practicing phrasing and structure, human for feedback on how I come across, tone, confidence, if my story lands.
Anna: For values clarification, figuring out what you really want?
Daniel: Human. AI gets cliche there. A human can hold silence and challenge me in a useful way.
Anna: For handling rejection and motivation?
Daniel: Honestly, friends. But if it’s between AI and coach, then human. AI can help at 2 a.m. with calming words, but it’s limited.
Anna: I want to add a quick rating moment. From 0 to 10, how would you rate your trust in human career coaches or mentors for your situation?
Daniel: I’d say 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Daniel: Because humans can be great, and I experienced that. But it’s inconsistent. So I trust the concept, not automatically the person.
Anna: And your trust in AI tools like ChatGPT, 0 to 10?
Daniel: Maybe 5.
Anna: Why 5?
Daniel: It’s useful, but it can hallucinate and miss context. I trust it for writing support, not for truth.
Anna: Now effectiveness. How effective has human coaching been for your situation overall, 0 to 10?
Daniel: Effectiveness… maybe 4.
Anna: Why 4?
Daniel: Because only one session really changed things. The rest felt like noise. And I still don’t have stable work, so overall impact is low.
Anna: And effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10?
Daniel: Maybe 6.
Anna: Why higher?
Daniel: Because it actually improved the output my CV language, cover letters, and speed. I got more replies when my documents were clearer. It doesn’t solve direction, but it helps a lot with production.


7) Trust–effectiveness link
Anna: In your experience, how do trust and effectiveness connect? Do you have examples where you trusted someone but it wasn’t effective, or where something was effective but you didn’t really trust it?
Daniel: Yeah, both. Trusted but not effective: I had a mentor who was very kind and validating. I felt safe, I trusted her as a person. But she didn’t give concrete actions. I left feeling warm, but nothing changed.
Anna: And effective but not trusted?
Daniel: The big tech mentor. His advice had useful parts impact, decision-making story, stronger narrative. But I didn’t trust him because he seemed okay with exaggerating and he was distracted. I still took some tips, but it cost energy. If you don’t trust, you second-guess everything, so it’s harder to act.
Anna: So distrust creates friction?
Daniel: Exactly. Trust makes implementation faster. Distrust makes me overthink. Trust is like a multiplier.
Anna: And with AI, do you see the same pattern?
Daniel: Yeah. AI can be effective but not trusted, like it writes something good but I don’t trust it’s authentic or accurate. And trusted but not effective is like emotional comfort—safe, but not changing anything long-term.
8) Preferences & hybrid model reaction
Anna: Imagine a hybrid model where AI helps you prepare and organize things, and a human coach steps in for deeper conversations and decision points. What’s your reaction?
Daniel: That sounds good. AI can handle the annoying part—rewriting, templates, checklists. And the human can do the meaning part and also verify reality.
Anna: Verify what?
Daniel: Context. Like what companies actually require German, what roles are truly junior-friendly, what hiring expectations look like here. AI might list companies, but a human in Germany can reality-check.
Anna: What would make you trust a hybrid system like that?
Daniel: Transparency about what AI does and doesn’t do. Privacy. And quality of matching for the human part. If the human part is random like ADPList sometimes, hybrid doesn’t solve it.
Anna: Matching seems central for you.
Daniel: Yeah. My one good mentor worked because she understood the Germany market and immigrant stress. If a system matches me with someone who gets those constraints, trust goes up.
Anna: Any concerns about hybrid models?
Daniel: That AI becomes too central and flattens nuance. Or the human just repeats what AI says, then why pay. And also I worry about incentives, like upselling or pushing me into a path that benefits the platform.
Anna: What would reduce that concern?
Daniel: Clear boundaries, maybe evidence like testimonials, and making it easy to switch mentors without shame. If switching is normalized, it’s easier to find a real fit.
Anna: How does that compare to your experience with ADPList?
Daniel: ADPList feels like speed dating. Profiles are vague, quality varies. Also I spent the first ten minutes explaining my context every time. That repetition is exhausting and it affects trust.
9) Closing
Anna: We’re almost at the end. If you could tell people designing career support tools what they should understand about someone in your situation, what would you say?
Daniel: Don’t underestimate admin stress or insurance, contracts, Anmeldung. It affects risk. People say take a risk, but here risk is tied to paperwork. And junior designers need very specific feedback, not like your portfolio is good also I want to not feel judged for language or being foreign. When someone acknowledges it’s harder, I trust them more, but then they also need to help me act.
Anna: If you could design the perfect support session for yourself next week, what would it look like?
Daniel: AI first i upload my CV and two job descriptions, it gives adjustments and a checklist. Then human: 45 minutes to decide my positioning and narrative, and to commit to a plan. And maybe a short follow-up with next steps for accountability.
Anna: What would make you walk away thinking, this was effective?
Daniel: If I have a plan I actually believe in, and I feel less scattered. Ideally it leads to interviews, but even without that, effectiveness is knowing what to do and why.
Anna: Anything you want to add before we stop?
Daniel: Not really. I’m curious what patterns you’ll find, but yeah. That’s it.
Anna: Thanks, Daniel. I’m stopping the recording now. And just to reiterate, everything will be anonymized. Thanks again for your time.
Daniel: Thank you. Bye.
Anna: Bye.


























































Simon




1. Opening and consent


Anna: Hi Simon, can you hear me well?


Simon: Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me too?


Anna: Yes, perfectly. Thanks for joining. Before we start, I want to quickly go through consent. Is it okay if I m recording the audio of this interview? The recording is only for transcription, it will be anonymized, and you can skip any question or stop at any time.


Simon: Yes, that is okay. You can record.


Anna: Great, thanks. Just to confirm, we will use a pseudonym for you, and anything identifying like company name or specific people, we will keep generic. If I ask something that feels too specific, you can just say pass.


Simon: Yeah alright 


Anna: also the topic is trust and perceived effectiveness in AI based career coaching versus human career coaching. There are no right answers. I am interested in your experience and your thinking. Does that sound okay?


Simon: Yes, totally.


Anna: Perfect. I will start the recording now. Okay, recording is on. To warm up, how are you doing today?


Simon: Um, fine. A bit tired because I was debugging something since morning, but yeah, okay hahahah 


Anna: Sounds very on brand for a machine learning engineer. hahaha . Okay, let us start.
2) Participant context and career situation


Anna: To begin, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now or have recently faced?


Simon: Okay. So i  am 24, and i am finishing my Master degree in Germany. I have a physics background, like my Bachelor was physics, and then I moved into more data science and machine learning during my Master. Right now I work in a Munich startup in a student role. The title is something like AI product engineer, but it is basically a mix of ML engineering and product work. And the main career thing is that I already signed a full-time offer with the same startup. So, in about two months after graduation I start full time, and it also has a Blue Card pathway. So in that sense the big decision is kind of done, but I still have like smaller questions: what direction do I want long term, how do I build toward product management, and how do I handle the German bureaucracy without losing my mind hahaha. 


Anna: Oh, German bureaucracy is crazy right. When you say the big decision is done, can you tell me what made that decision significant for you?


Simon: It is like, it locks in the next chapter. I moved here from Brazil two years ago for the Master. So the decision is not only job, it is also, do I stay in Germany, do I build a life here, do I commit to the visa path, all those things. Munich is expensive, rent is crazy, and at the same time career wise it is a good place for tech, at least for what I do. So the offer is not just money, it is stability, residence permit, being able to plan. Also it confirms that my pivot from physics into ML actually worked. That felt big.


Anna: What was most difficult about it, in the last months? Was it uncertainty, lack of information, pressure, fear of mistakes, something else?


Simon: A mix. Uncertainty about the market, because everyone talks about layoffs, and also in Germany there is like this vibe of, you need to be very qualified, very formal, like your CV must be perfect. Also pressure from timeline. My student residence permit is tied to finishing studies, and then you have this job-seeking period, and you have to do paperwork, and the Ausländerbehörde appointments are… yeah. So I had a time pressure, like if I do not get an offer fast enough, it becomes messy. And fear of mistakes, yes. Like, if I accept the wrong role, maybe I get stuck writing code forever, and I already know I want to move more toward product. So I wanted a role that gives me credibility technically but also lets me touch product.


Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed during that time?


Simon: Practical and emotional, both. Practical as in how do I position myself, how do I explain the physics background, how do I write a CV that fits the German style, how do I prepare for ML interviews, and also how do I negotiate, like salary, contract terms, and Blue Card stuff. Emotional support is more like am I making a mistake moving countries, what if I fail, what if I do not fit in. But I am a bit self-directed, so I mostly tried to build my own structure. Still, I used tools and people.


Anna: When you say self-directed, what does that look like for you in practice?


Simon: I set my own milestones. Like, I created a spreadsheet with companies, roles, deadlines, status. I decided, okay, every week I apply to X roles, every weekend I work on portfolio projects, and I go to meetups to get referrals. Also I have a clear picture of what I want next. Like, short term I am okay doing hands-on ML. Mid term I want to be closer to product decisions, user needs, and strategy. I do not want to be coding all day forever. And because I know that, I choose activities that push me there, like I ask to join product meetings, or I do user story writing sometimes, even if my job is technical.


Anna: That is helpful. Can you describe the startup a bit, in a generic way, and what you do there day to day?


Simon: Sure. It is a B2B startup, Munich-based, around industrial IT and predictive maintenance. So we have sensor data from machines, and we build models to predict failures or optimize maintenance schedules. My tasks are mixed. Some days I do data pipelines, like cleaning time series, feature engineering. Some days I train models and evaluate them, and make them production-ready, like monitoring, drift checks, that stuff. And because we are small, I also do product things, like talking to the product manager, translating client pain points into model requirements, writing internal docs, and sometimes presenting results to clients. It is very fast. Like, you ship fast, then you fix. Not always perfect.


Anna: What was your path into that role? How did you find it and what did the hiring process look like?


Simon: I found it through LinkedIn plus a meetup connection. I went to a machine learning meetup in Munich, like one of those evening events with pizza, and I talked to someone who later became my internal referral. Then I applied on LinkedIn, and the process was: first a recruiter screen, then a technical interview with an ML engineer, then a take-home assignment. The assignment was like, here is a dataset, build a small model, explain your choices, and write a short report. Then I had a final interview with the CTO plus product manager, more like system design and product sense: how would you deploy this, how would you handle feedback from customers, how do you prioritize. And also some behavioral questions.


Anna: How did you feel in those steps? Any part particularly challenging?


Simon: The take-home was time-consuming. Also the product sense questions, because I came from physics and like pure engineering mindset. In physics you are trained to be correct, not necessarily to be pragmatic. In startup you need to say, okay, we cannot be perfect, we need something that works and creates value. So I had to learn to talk in that language. Also speaking English is fine for me, but sometimes German comes in, like documents or bureaucracy, and then you feel less confident.


Anna: What languages do you use day to day?


Simon: At work mostly English. Some colleagues speak German in side conversations, but meetings are English because we have international people. My German is like B1-ish, maybe. I can do basics like Anmeldung, or at the doctor, but professional German, no. And outside work, in Munich, you can survive in English, but for bureaucracy you need German or someone who helps.


Anna: What was your relocation story, briefly? What brought you to Germany?


Simon: I wanted a strong Master program in data and AI, and Germany was attractive because tuition is low compared to like the US or UK. Also I liked the idea of being in Europe, like more stability. I applied to programs, got into one in Munich, moved here in 2024. The first months were intense: finding a room, Anmeldung, opening bank account, health insurance, like Krankenkasse, all that. And then adapting to winter. Hahaha. Brazil to Munich winter is… yeah.


Anna:  Hahaha. Yes. And you said you have a full-time offer starting in two months after graduation. What does the Blue Card pathway mean to you personally?


Simon: It means I can stop being stressed all the time. Because the visa situation affects everything. Like, you cannot sign a long rent contract if you are unsure. You cannot plan travel easily. You always think, what if the appointment is late. So Blue Card is like a feeling of legitimacy. Also it is a signal that my salary and contract are in a good range. But it is also paperwork, and it depends on rules, and rules can change. So it is not pure comfort, but it is better than being on student status.


Anna: Okay. That gives me a good overview. Let us move to how you usually get career support.


3) Career support in general


Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?


Simon: Um, first myself  like, I read a lot, I do research. Then I talk to a few people: friends who are also in tech, some classmates, and one mentor I have informally. Not like official mentoring, but a guy I met at university who works as a data scientist, maybe 5 years older, and we talk sometimes. I also used the university career center once, like they had a CV check. And then honestly I use AI tools a lot, mainly ChatGPT, for writing and structuring.


Anna: What tends to actually help you, and what tends to feel unhelpful or frustrating?


Simon: Helpful is concrete feedback. Like, if someone reads my CV and says, this line is unclear, this is too long, this does not show impact. Or if they tell me, for this role you need to emphasize A and B. Also helpful is reality checks about the market, like, do not apply to only big tech, also look at middlestrandt or look at startups. Unhelpful is generic advice like, follow your passion, or network more, or just be confident. Like, yeah, okay, but what do I do tomorrow. Also unhelpful is when people give advice that does not fit my context as an immigrant in Germany. Like, someone might say, just walk in and talk to the manager, but in Germany that is weird


Anna: If you think about the support you got during your job search, what were the top channels for you?


Simon: LinkedIn for sure, because it is easy and you see roles. Referrals through meetups helped a lot. GitHub and portfolio also mattered, because in ML, having projects that show you can do end-to-end is important. And also my university network, like professors or labs, not super strong but some.


Anna: Did you use any other resources, like online communities, forums, or events?


Simon: Yes, meetups, like Munich ML meetup or something like that i dont remember the name of it , had a very funny one actually , also some AI product events. And I read blogs, like on interview prep, and watched YouTube videos for system design. But you need to filter because a lot of content is US market focused. In Germany interviews are sometimes different. But the ML fundamentals are universal.


Anna: When you evaluate career advice in general, what makes you take it seriously?


Simon: Two things. One is competence, like does the person actually know what they are talking about, have they done it. The other is fit, like do they understand my goals and constraints. If advice is competent but not fitting, it can still be interesting, but I might not follow it. And I also value honesty about uncertainty. Like, if someone says, it depends, and then explains what it depends on, I trust that more than someone being very sure.


Anna: That is a nice transition into trust. Next I will ask specifically about human coaching, but you mentioned you have not had offline coaching. So we will talk about expectations.
4) Human coaching experience and trust 


Anna: Have you ever had an offline or online career coaching session with a professional coach, like a paid coach or a structured program?


Simon: No, not in the classic sense. I never paid a coach or went to a private career coach. I only used the university career center, but that was more like a service, not coaching. It was like, here are tips, fixed appointment, very practical.


Anna: Okay. So if you imagine a human career coach, what do you expect they would do with you? What would you want from them, given your situation?


Simon: I would want them to help me with strategy and positioning. Like, how do I present myself as someone who is technical but wants to move toward product. Also I would want them to help me identify gaps: what skills do I need, what experiences do I need. And maybe accountability, like, if I say I will do X, then they check. Also maybe help with negotiation and career planning. And honestly, emotional support too, like someone who can listen and reflect back, because moving countries and building a career is stressful.


Anna: What would make you trust a human coach?


Simon: Hhm let me think… Competence i guess. Like, they should have experience with tech careers. If it is a general coach who only coached like marketing people, I would worry. Also kindness or empathy,or  like when they should listen properly, not rush not judge and confidentiality. Because career topics can be sensitive, like visa status, salary, insecurities. I need to feel safe that they do not share it or use it in a weird way. Thats all i think. No  structure also. Structure yes. Like, I like a plan. I do not want just a conversation, I want some framework, goals, follow-ups. And also feeling seen, like they understand my background and my specific context.


Anna: When you say feeling seen, how would you notice that in a session?


Simon: The questions they ask. If they ask generic questions like, what are your strengths, and then they give a generic summary, I would not feel seen. But if they pick up on details, like, you said you liked bridging technical and business, tell me more, and then they connect it to a plan, then I feel they actually listened. Also if they remember what I said last time, like small details.


Anna: What would be red flags for you with a human coach?


Simon: Sales vibe. Like if in the first 10 minutes they push their package, or they say, you need 10 sessions, pay now, I would not like that. Also false certainty, like, I guarantee you will get a job in 2 weeks. That is unrealistic. Another red flag is if they do not understand tech context and still act like they do. Like mixing up basic concepts, or giving advice that is clearly not relevant. Also confidentiality doubts, like if they talk about other clients in too much detail. And also if they are too moralizing, like judging your choices.


Anna: If you think about your own attitude, you said you generally trust career coaches and believe they often help. Where does that belief come from, if you have not used one yourself?


Simon: From observing friends and also from the idea that talking to an experienced person can help you see blind spots. Like, coaching is basically structured reflection plus expertise. I have seen friends who had coaches for job changes, and they got clarity and made decisions faster. Also, I guess I am open to the concept. I do not think coaches are magic, but I think they can help if they are good and if the client is engaged. I would consider it in the future, maybe when I want to make a bigger transition, like from engineering to product management.


Anna: You also mentioned you have considered becoming a career coach later for technical specialists. Can you tell me what you mean by that?


Simon: Yeah. Like, in tech, a lot of people struggle with interviews, or with presenting themselves, or with deciding between paths like research, engineering, product, management. And someone who has been through it could help, especially if they know how to prepare for coding interviews, ML interviews, system design, and also how to communicate impact. I could imagine doing that later, as a side thing, like helping people with CVs, interview prep, career strategy in tech. But not now. Now I need to build my own career first. 


Anna: Makes sense. If you were to choose a coach, what would you look for in their background or credentials?


Simon: I would look for someone who has worked in tech, ideally in Germany or Europe, because context matters. Maybe someone who has been an engineer and then moved to product, because that is my goal. Also I would look for testimonials, but carefully, because testimonials can be marketing. I would look for a first session that feels like value, not just sales. And maybe some proof of methodology, like how they work, what is the process. And I would prefer someone who can speak English, obviously, and maybe some German knowledge could help with local context.


Anna: Okay. Let us switch to AI tools, where you do have experience. 


5) AI tools experience and trust 


Anna: Can you tell me about your experience using AI tools for career-related questions? What have you used, and for what?


Simon: Mainly ChatGPT. I also tried Claude once, but mostly сhat because it is convenient and I already have a routine. I used it for rewriting my CV, rewriting bullet points, translating things into a more professional English. Also for LinkedIn summary, like how to position myself. And for interview prep: generating likely questions, practicing answers, and also explaining ML concepts in a way that is interview-friendly. Like, if I know the math, but I need to explain it clearly. It helped a lot, honestly.


Anna: You said it helped you get the job by rewriting your CV. Can you walk me through that episode? What exactly did you do and what changed?


Simon: Yes. So initially my CV was very academic. Physics style. Like, lots of theory, not enough impact. And also the language was not good, because I wrote in a kind of formal, but not business-friendly way. I took my CV text, removed personal details, and pasted bullet points into сhat. I asked something like: rewrite these bullets for an AI product engineer role in a German startup, emphasize impact, use action verbs, keep it concise, quantify where possible. And it gave me a version that was much more readable.


Anna: What was different in the rewritten version?


Simon: It was more outcome focused. Like, instead of saying, implemented a neural network, it would say, built a predictive model that reduced error by X, or improved detection of anomalies. It also suggested a structure: first a summary, then skills, then experience, then projects. And it helped me translate academic projects into product language. Like, I did a thesis project on time series forecasting, and chat helped me frame it as, developed forecasting pipeline for industrial sensor data, evaluated models, deployed prototype. That kind of framing.


Anna: How did you decide what to keep and what to change?


Simon: I did not just copy paste. I compared it with job descriptions and with other CV examples. I took the good parts, and I edited. Also I checked for accuracy, because sometimes it invents metrics. Like it will say, improved performance by 30 percent, but I did not measure that. So I had to be careful. I used it like a draft generator, not as truth.


Anna: Did you notice any emotional impact from that process? Like confidence, stress level?


Simon: Yes, it reduced stress, because the blank page problem is real. Like, you know you did stuff, but writing it in a good way is hard. When chat gave me a draft, I felt, okay, I can work with this. It also made me more confident to apply, because I felt my CV was not embarrassing hahaha. And I did get more interview invitations after improving it, so that reinforced it.


Anna: Can you share a moment where ChatGPT truly helped beyond writing? Something like a decision, or preparation, or clarity?


Simon: Interview prep. There was one interview where they asked product sense questions. Like, how do you decide what model to deploy, how do you trade off accuracy versus latency, how do you communicate uncertainty to a client. I practiced with chat by giving it the context and asking it to act like an interviewer. And then I responded, and it gave feedback, like, you focused too much on technical details, mention business impact, mention monitoring, mention user trust. That helped me. In the actual interview, I was more structured. And I think that contributed to the offer.


Anna: Do you remember a specific piece of feedback that stuck?


Simon: Yes. It said something like, always connect model decisions to stakeholder needs. Like, if the client needs reliability, talk about robustness and monitoring, not just metrics. And also, do not oversell, be clear about limitations. That is aligned with how Germans like things, I think, like realistic. So I used that.


Anna: And can you share a moment when ChatGPT failed you or felt unhelpful?


Simon: Definitely. Sometimes it gives generic output. Like, you ask, how do I move from ML engineer to product manager, and it gives the same list: learn business, talk to stakeholders, build roadmap. It is true but too generic. Another failure was hallucination. I asked it about Blue Card requirements and timelines, and it confidently gave wrong information. Like it mixed up salary thresholds and said something about documents that was not correct for my case. I noticed because I cross-checked with official sources and with my company HR. So that was a big reminder: do not trust it for legal specifics.


Anna: How did that affect your trust?


Simon: It lowered it for that domain. Like, I trust it for writing and brainstorming, but for legal or visa stuff, I treat it as a rough starting point at most. If it speaks with too much certainty in areas where rules change, I get suspicious.


Anna: Any other concerns?


Simon: Privacy. Like, CV contains personal info. I tried to remove name, address, company names, but still, you share your career story. So I am careful. I do not paste full contracts or visa letters. Also sometimes it makes assumptions about my background, like it will assume I am a software engineer with 5 years experience, because the prompt is vague. Then the answer is not tailored.


Anna: How do you verify AI outputs in general?


Simon: I do a few things. For factual claims, I ask for sources or I cross-check with credible websites. For writing, I check for tone, and I make sure it is truthful. For interview prep, I compare with real interview guides and with feedback from humans. Also I sometimes run the same question with a different phrasing, to see if the answer is consistent. If it changes drastically, I know it is shaky.


Anna: What makes it feel trustworthy to you, like in the moment?


Simon: When it reflects my context correctly. Like, when I give it details and it uses them. Also when it shows nuance, like, it does not just say do X, but says, here are options, here are trade-offs. And when it admits uncertainty, like, I am not sure, or it depends. That increases trust. If it is too confident, I trust less.


Anna: That is a good point. Let us move into comparison.


6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks 


Anna: I want to compare human coaching and AI tools via specific career tasks. I will name a task, and I would like you to tell me which you would prefer for that task and why. Does that work?


Simon: Yes.


Anna: First task: rewriting a CV and LinkedIn profile for a specific role in Germany. What would you prefer, human coach or AI tool?


Simon: For first draft and iteration, AI tool. It is fast and you can do many versions. But for final polish, especially if it is high-stakes, I would like a human review, ideally someone who knows the market. Because AI can make it sound good, but maybe it misses local expectations, like German CV style, or it can create too much fluff. So I would do AI first, then human second.


Anna: What is the advantage of AI there, in your experience?


Simon: Speed. You can ask 20 times, rewrite this bullet, shorten, make it more impact-focused, tailor to job description. A human would get tired, or it would be expensive. Also AI is non-judgmental, you can ask stupid questions hahaha


Anna: Agreed. And what is the advantage of a human there?


Simon: Context and honesty. A human can say, this claim sounds unrealistic, or this project is not relevant, remove it. Also humans can pick up subtle things, like this sounds arrogant, or this is too humble. And they can ask you follow-up questions to get more detail.


Anna: Second task: choosing between two offers, like startup versus corporate, or Germany versus another country. Who would you prefer?


Simon: Human. Because that is more values and trade offs. AI can help list pros and cons, but a human can challenge you, like, you say you want stability but you choose startup, why. A human can also understand emotions, like fear, identity. AI is more mechanical.


Anna: Third task: interview preparation, technical and behavioral. What would you prefer?


Simon: Hybrid. AI for drilling questions and structuring answers, human for realistic feedback and for understanding how an interviewer in that company thinks. Like, a human who has done ML interviews can say, your answer is too theoretical, or you missed the point.


Anna: Fourth task: dealing with German bureaucracy and visa stress, like residence permit, Blue Card steps. What would you prefer?


Simon: Human, or official sources, not AI. Hahaha. AI is too risky there. It can give outdated info. A human like HR or a relocation consultant or someone who went through it is better. AI can maybe help translate a letter or explain vocabulary, like what does this title? Auf title? I dont remember hahaha what does it mean, but not advice.


Anna: Okay. I will now embed a quick micro-poll. I will ask you to rate some things from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust or not effective at all, and 10 is complete trust or extremely effective. There is no correct number. I care about why. Is that okay?


Simon: Yes.


Anna: First rating: trust in human career coaches, even though you have not used one. Based on your expectations. What number from 0 to 10?


Simon: I would say 7.


Anna: Why 7 and not lower?


Simon: Because I think many coaches genuinely want to help and have experience. The human element, empathy, confidentiality, that creates trust for me. Also if someone has a reputation and credentials, I would trust them. So baseline is positive.


Anna: Why not higher than 7?


Simon: Because variability. Some coaches are great, some are not. And without personal experience, I cannot say 9 or 10. Also, there is always the risk of generic advice or misfit. And sometimes coaching can be more about motivation than real strategy. For me, I want substance. So 7 feels like, I am open and generally trusting, but not naive.


Anna: Second rating: trust in AI tools for career support, like ChatGPT, for your use. 0 to 10.


Simon: For trust, maybe 6.


Anna: Why 6?


Simon: Because it is useful and often accurate in writing and general guidance, but it can be delulu and it lacks true understanding of my life. So I trust it conditionally. I trust it as a tool, not as an authority. Also privacy concerns reduce trust a bit.


Anna: What would make it a 7 or 8 for you?


Simon: Better transparency about sources, like if it shows where it got info, and if it has strong guardrails like, for legal topics it refuses or says it is uncertain. Also if there was a mode that guarantees not storing data, or a clear privacy contract, that would increase trust.


Anna: Third rating: perceived effectiveness of human coaching for your situation, expected effectiveness. 0 to 10.


Simon: I would say 7 again.


Anna: What does effectiveness mean to you here?


Simon: Effectiveness is outcomes. Like, does it help me make decisions, create action steps, build confidence, actually improve results like interviews passed or better offers. For human coaching, I expect it can be effective if the coach is good and fits my goals. They can help with strategy and accountability. So 7.


Anna: Why not 9?


Simon: Because it is not magic. Also I am already quite structured. A coach might not add huge value for me in basic things. It would be more effective in specific transitions, like moving to product. But in general, I think it is helpful, not transformational always.


Anna: Fourth rating: perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, based on your experience. 0 to 10.


Simon: For effectiveness, I would say 8.


Anna: Why 8?


Simon: Because it actually produced concrete outcomes for me. It improved my CV, it helped me prepare, and I got the job. Also it saves time every day. So in effectiveness terms, it is high. Even if I do not fully trust it, it is effective for certain tasks.


Anna: Why not 10?


Simon: Because it fails in areas like legal specifics, and it can be generic. And it cannot replace a human for deep reflection or accountability. Also, sometimes it makes me overthink. Like, you ask too many questions and you get too many options. 


Anna: That is very clear. Thank you. Let us go deeper into trust and effectiveness as separate things, because you already started to distinguish them.


7) Trust-effectiveness link 


Anna: When you think about trust, what does it mean for you in this context? And separately, what does effectiveness mean? You started defining effectiveness, but I want to hear it in your own words.


Simon: Okay. Trust is like, do I believe the source is competent, and do I feel safe using it. Competence means it gives good guidance, it understands context, it does not mislead. Safe means confidentiality, not being judged, not being exploited, like not being manipulated. Also trust includes empathy for humans, like feeling understood. For AI, empathy is not real, but you can still feel comfortable if it is respectful and consistent.


Effectiveness is results. Like, after using it, do I have more clarity, do I take action, do I make a decision faster, do I perform better in interviews, do I get offers, do I feel more confident. It is more measurable, at least in my head.


Anna: How do trust and effectiveness connect for you? For example, if you trust something more, does it automatically become more effective?


Simon: Not automatically, but it changes how I use it. If I trust a coach, I will share more details, and then they can tailor better, so it becomes more effective. If I do not trust, I hold back, and then the advice is generic, so less effective. But there is also the opposite: something can be effective even if I do not fully trust it, like AI. I do not fully trust it, but it still helps, because I use it in a limited way.


Anna: Can you give an example of low trust but some effectiveness, from your experience?


Simon: Yes. When I used chat to generate interview questions for the startup, I did not trust it fully because it might not know the company. But it still produced a structured list: ML fundamentals, system design, product questions, behavioral. Even if some questions were not exactly asked, the structure helped me prepare. So effectiveness was there, but trust was moderate.


Anna: And can you give an example of high trust but low effectiveness, even hypothetically?


Simon: Hypothetically, yes. Imagine a human coach who is very empathetic, very supportive, you feel safe, you trust them personally. But they do not have tech context and they give advice like, just show your passion, or network more, or do a generic resume template. Then you might feel good emotionally, high trust, but outcomes are not improved. So low effectiveness for my goals.


Anna: That is a strong distinction. Can the opposite happen, high effectiveness but low trust?


Simon: Yes, similar to AI. Or even with a human. Like, you could have a very direct reviewer, maybe a hiring manager, who is harsh, you do not feel emotionally safe, but they give very precise feedback that improves your CV. So you do not trust them as a person, but the advice is effective. That can happen.


Anna: What about trust in terms of confidentiality. How important is that in career conversations?


Simon: Very important. Especially as an immigrant. Visa status, salary, insecurity about language, these are vulnerable topics. With a human coach, I would need a clear confidentiality agreement. With AI, confidentiality is more like data privacy. If I think my data could be stored or used, I will limit what I share. And then effectiveness goes down because it lacks context.


Anna: That is interesting. So your trust influences how much context you provide, and that influences effectiveness.


Simon: Exactly.


Anna: Are there any moments where you felt you had to choose between trust and convenience?


Simon: Yes. Convenience is AI. You can do it anytime, late night, quick. Trust is more human, but it costs time and money. Sometimes I choose convenience. Like, at 1 am, I am not going to call a coach. I will ask chat. Even if trust is lower, it is available.


Anna: In those moments, do you notice any boundaries you set with the AI?


Simon: Yes, I keep it at the level of content, not personal secrets. Like, I talk about how to phrase things, how to structure, but I do not paste personal documents. Also I remind myself that it can be wrong, so I treat it as suggestions. I think that boundary helps maintain both trust and effectiveness in the limited domain.


Anna: What would make you stop using an AI tool for career support?


Simon: If it repeatedly gives wrong info in a way that harms me. Like, if I follow advice and it leads to a bad outcome. Also if there was a data scandal, like my data is leaked. Or if it becomes too manipulative, like it pushes certain services. Basically if the risk becomes high.


Anna: And what would make you stop using a human coach, hypothetically?


Simon: Same vibe i guess  if they break confidentiality, if they push sales, if they do not listen, if they give generic advice, if they pretend certainty, or if they do not respect my autonomy. I do not want someone to tell me what to do, I want someone to support my decision-making.


Anna: Great. Now I want to explore your preferences and the idea of hybrid models.


8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction


Anna: Imagine a hybrid model where AI helps with preparation, structuring, and follow-up, and a human coach helps with deep reflection, accountability, and high-stakes decisions. What is your initial reaction?


Simon: That sounds like the best combination, in theory. Because it uses AI where it is strong: repetitive tasks, drafts, brainstorming, 24/7. And it uses humans where they are strong: understanding context, emotions, and making you commit to actions. I think hybrid can also reduce cost, because you do not need a human for every small thing.


Anna: What parts of that hybrid idea feel attractive to you personally?


Simon: The workflow. Like, I could use AI to prepare before a session: write my thoughts, clarify my questions, generate options. Then in the human session, we go deeper, and we decide. After that, AI could help me execute: write emails, update CV, plan steps, reminders. That would be very efficient.


Anna: What parts feel risky or unclear?


Simon: Data flow. Like, does the human coach see what I wrote to AI. How is it stored. Who owns the data. Also accountability. If AI gives a plan and the human gives another plan, what is the source of truth. Also quality control: if the AI output is wrong, does the human correct it, or do you end up trusting wrong stuff. And the boundary of roles: when do you escalate to human, when do you stay with AI.


Anna: If you could design the hybrid model for someone like you, what would be the rules for when AI leads versus when a human leads?


Simon: AI leads when tasks are low emotional and more technical: rewriting text, summarizing job descriptions, preparing interview question lists, generating templates, translating. Human leads when tasks involve values, identity, long-term decisions, or sensitive topics like negotiation, visa strategy, or conflict at work. Also human leads when I feel stuck emotionally, like anxiety or self-doubt, because AI can be supportive but it is not real empathy.


Anna: What would make you trust a hybrid platform more?


Simon: Transparency. Like, clear explanation of what AI does, what human does, how data is handled, how matching works if there is matching. Also clear limitations: do not promise guarantees. And quality of humans: vetted coaches with relevant backgrounds. Also, I would like the AI part to show sources when it claims facts, and to separate facts from suggestions.


Anna: Would you personally pay for such a hybrid service?


Simon: Maybe, yes, if I am at a transition point. Right now I already have a job offer, so I do not urgently need it. But for the move to product management, I might pay, because that is strategic and it is harder. If the hybrid service can provide a coach who actually did that path, plus AI to support execution, that is valuable.


Anna: What would be a deal-breaker?


Simon: If it feels like a funnel to sell courses, or if it is too generic. Also if privacy is unclear. And if the coaches are not credible. Like, if they are generalists, it would not fit. I need someone who understands technical roles.


Anna: How would you want the coach to interact with you, style-wise?


Simon: Calm, structured, not too motivational. I prefer someone who asks good questions and also gives concrete feedback. Like, a mix of coaching and consulting. Some coaches are purely reflective, but I also like directness.


Anna: If the platform offered AI-only, human-only, and hybrid, what would you choose for different situations?


Simon: AI-only for quick tasks like cover letter drafts, bullet rewrites, interview question practice. Human-only for big decisions and personal topics. Hybrid for structured career planning over time, where you want both reflection and execution support.


Anna: Great. We are close to closing. I want to ask one more thing: looking back, what do you think was the most effective support you used in your job search, and why?


9) Closing


Simon: Most effective was actually a combination: chat for writing and prep, plus human input from my referral and from my manager. Like, the referral helped me understand what the startup needed, what to emphasize. Chat helped me produce materials fast and practice. So effectiveness came from combining resources. The AI tool gave me speed, but humans gave me credibility.


Anna: If you had to describe in one sentence what trust means for you in this topic, what would you say?


Simon: Trust means I feel safe sharing enough context, and I believe the guidance is competent and honest not like manipulative to get money out of me hahaha. 


Anna: And one sentence for effectiveness?


Simon: Effectiveness means it leads to concrete progress


Anna: Thank you.  Is there anything you expected me to ask but I did not, or anything you want to add?


Simon: Maybe just that for early-career people in tech, the barrier is often not knowledge, it is communication. Like, you can be good, but you cannot present it. AI helps with that a lot. But humans help with confidence and with navigating systems. So both matter.


Anna: That is a valuable point. Thank you. Just to close formally, do you have any questions for me about the study or what happens next?


Simon: No, I think it is clear. You will anonymize and use it for research.


Anna: Exactly. We will transcribe, remove identifying details, and use it as part of thematic analysis. If later you want to withdraw, you can message me. Thank you for your time and for being so thoughtful!


Simon: Sure. Thank you. It was interesting.


Anna: Thank you so much i will stop the recording now.  


















































Lisa
1) Opening and consent
Anna: Hi Lisa, thanks for joining. Before we start, i am recording this meet do I have your permission to record this conversation for research purposes?
Lisa: Yes, you have my permission to record.
Anna: Thank you. Just to reiterate: everything is anonymous, I will use a pseudonym, and you can skip any question or stop at any time. Does that feel okay?
Lisa: Yes, that is fine.
Anna: Great. Also, if anything feels too personal, just tell me and we move on. 
Lisa: Okay. 
Anna: Perfect. How is your day going so far?
Lisa: Busy, as always. I had two long  calls already, and then I was like, okay, now Zoom number three. But it is okay, I have coffee.
Anna: Great. Then let us start.
2) Participant context and career situation
Anna: To begin, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now?
Lisa: Okay. So, I am 28. I studied marketing in Germany, like classic, Bachelor and then Master. I started in a smaller agency first, then I moved to BCG. I am in marketing at BCG, not consulting. So, I am internal. I work on go to market and brand, and also campaign stuff, and some content, and internal stakeholder management. And right now my big question is: I want to transition from marketing into product management, or like a bridge, product marketing into PM. Because I want to build products, not only meaning or messaging. And that is, eehm, not a small shift, especially inside BCG.
Anna: When you say build products, what do you mean by product in your head?
Lisa: Good question. Because in consulting, people say product and it can mean many things. For me it means something that is used, like a tool, a digital product, maybe a platform, maybe internal product, maybe client facing, but with an actual user, an interface, a roadmap, prioritization, discovery, metrics. Not just, okay, we have an offer and we market it nicely. It is like owning the problem, and iterating. I want to be closer to that.
Anna: And what is pushing that now, in this last period?
Lisa: There was a trigger, yes. In the last, I would say, six to nine months, I was staffed on a project, not as a consultant but kind of supporting with marketing, for a digital product BCG was building internally for a client team. It was like a prototype, and we had a product owner from the consulting side, and designers, and some engineers. And I was invited because they needed positioning and messaging, yes, but then I ended up doing more. Like, I was the person who translated user feedback into changes in the onboarding flow. I wrote the first version of the user stories. I ran a workshop with internal users. And I felt, um, it sounds dramatic, but I felt alive. Like, this is the thing. And then I went back to my usual marketing cycle, where it is like, we polish a deck, we align on wording for two weeks, and I was like, why does this feel empty now?
Anna: So there was a comparison experience.
Lisa: Exactly. And also, I had a moment with a senior stakeholder, like a partner, who said something like, you are so good at making this sound great, but what is the actual thing? And it was not mean. But it hit me. Because I was like, yes, I can make things sound great, but I also want to influence what the thing is. Not just the story. And then I started reading about PM, talking to people, and then coaching.
Anna: What made the decision difficult?
Lisa: Several things. One is credibility. In Germany, the job market for PM can be picky, like they want experience. Titles matter a bit. Also language expectations. Some PM roles say English is fine, but then you see, okay, German required. And inside BCG, there is internal politics. Like, internal mobility is possible, but it is not like you click a button and suddenly you are a PM. There are product roles in BCG X, in Platinion, in digital ventures, and also in internal knowledge teams, but you need sponsorship, and you need to show evidence. People will ask, have you shipped? Have you owned a backlog? Have you done discovery? And my CV says marketing. So that is the problem.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed?
Lisa: Structure. And honesty. And someone to, eehm, challenge me, but also not make me feel stupid. Because inside BCG, the environment is high pace and feedback culture is direct. It is polished, but it is also intense. You get feedback like, this is not sharp, this is not client ready. And I can handle that at work, but for my career, I needed someone who can hold the uncertainty with me. Like, am I making a mistake? Is this a fantasy? And then also practical support: CV, LinkedIn, target roles, experiments, interviews.
Anna: When you say uncertainty, what was the emotional part for you?
Lisa: The fear of losing status. And also, fear of disappointing myself. Like, I worked hard to get into BCG. It sounds silly because I am not even a consultant, but still, it is a known brand. And then to say, I want to switch, it is like, okay, am I ungrateful? And also fear of being rejected. Because PM interviews can be brutal, and I do not have the typical story. So, anxiety, yes.
Anna: Thank you.And are you considering switching internally, externally, or both?
Lisa: Both. Internally, because it is easier in some ways, like you already have the brand and network. But also harder because people know you as marketing Lisa. Externally, because Berlin ecosystem has many product roles, Munich too but different, more enterprise, more automotive, more B2B. And I am based in Munich. So, I am exploring both.
3) Career support in general
Anna: When you need career support in general, who or what do you usually turn to?
Lisa: Um, friends, definitely. I have two friends who are product managers. One is in a startup in Berlin, one is in a big corporate in Munich. I also talk to my boyfriend, but he is in finance, so he is supportive but not super helpful on the content. And then at BCG, there are mentors, like informal, not official. I asked one woman in BCG  for a coffee chat. And I used online resources, like articles, some podcasts, and AI tools, yes. And then human coaching, which is the main thing for me.
Anna: What has actually helped, and what felt unhelpful?
Lisa: Helpful is when people give examples practical. Like, not just, follow your passion, but like, okay, here is how I moved from function A to function B. Here is the story I told. Here is how I positioned my experience. That helps. Unhelpful is generic advice. Like, network more. Okay, yes, but how? And also, some advice was too confident. Like, just apply to PM roles, it will work out. And I was like, hmm, no, you do not see my actual profile and the market.
Anna: And within BCG, how is it to ask for career support?
Lisa: It depends. People are nice, but everyone is busy. Staffing cycles are fast, projects change, priorities change. And there is a culture of being composed. So, you can say, I am thinking about development, but to say, I feel lost, is harder. Also, there is sometimes a fear that if you say you want to leave your function, your manager will think you are not committed. So you have to navigate that. It is like, you share selectively.
Anna: Aha. And you mentioned AI tools as part of your support mix. We will come to that later.
Lisa: Yes.
4) Human coaching experience and trust
Anna: You said you do human coaching. Can you tell me how you started, and what that process looks like?
Lisa: Yes. So, I found my coach via LinkedIn, through a friend recommendation. A friend of mine worked with her, and she said, this woman is good, she is structured, she understands corporate, and she is not, um, like a motivational speaker type. And I was like, okay, that sounds like what I need. I checked her LinkedIn, she had experience in tech and some consulting background, and she had coached people into product roles. So I booked a first call.
Anna: What was the first call like?
Lisa: It was like a chemistry check. She asked about my situation, my goal, what I tried already. She was calm, very direct, and she did not promise magic. She said, we can work together, but it will be work, and we will measure progress. And that already created trust for me because it felt honest. Not like, you will be PM in six weeks. 
Anna: And what is the format now?
Lisa: We meet every two weeks, like therapy in cadence and depth. It is on video call, usually 60 minutes. And we have a process. Every session starts with a project audit. She asks, what did you do in the last two weeks? What projects at work? What side tasks? What decisions? And then she helps me identify product-like tasks inside my projects. Like, if I ran a stakeholder workshop, that is facilitation and discovery. If I defined a campaign KPI and tracked it, that is metrics. If I created a content journey based on user segments, that is user thinking. We translate.
Anna: So she is reframing your work through a product lens.
Lisa: Exactly. And then we rewrite my CV and LinkedIn around that. Not lying, but translating. And then we run job search as experiments. That is her style. We create hypotheses and test by response rates and callbacks. It is very, um, scientific.
Anna: Can you give a concrete example of one of these experiments?
Lisa: Yes. We did two CV variants. Variant A was more marketing heavy but with product adjacent language. Variant B was more aggressive, like product orientation, highlighting workshops, requirements, roadmap contributions, even if small. And then we targeted different roles. For A, we applied to product marketing roles, like PMM. For B, we applied to junior PM roles or associate PM roles, and also internal product roles. We tracked response rates in a spreadsheet. Like, how many applications, how many callbacks, how many recruiter screens, how many rejections, and why.
Anna: Do you remember any numbers, roughly?
Lisa: Um, yes, roughly. Variant A got like, maybe 20 to 25 percent callback for PMM, like recruiter replies. Variant B for PM roles got like 5 to 10 percent, which is not amazing, but it was not zero. And then we adjusted keywords. Like, we realized I used marketing language that PM recruiters ignore. We added words like discovery, backlog, stakeholder alignment, experimentation, prioritization. And we tailored the top summary. And then the response rate improved slightly, like from 5 percent to maybe 12 percent for some roles. Not huge, but enough to say, okay, it is possible.
Anna: How did that feel, emotionally, to treat job search like experiments?
Lisa: It helped my anxiety a lot. Because instead of, I got rejected, I am not good enough, it becomes, okay, hypothesis failed, adjust variables. It is less personal. It also fits my brain because at BCG we love frameworks. So it gave me something to hold onto.
Anna: You mentioned coaching is expensive but effective for you. Can you talk about that?
Lisa: Yes. It is expensive. I pay, um, I will not say exact number, but it is a significant amount per session. For Germany, it is not cheap. And I hesitated. I was like, should I spend this money? But I see it as investment. And I already feel outcomes. Like, clarity, reduced anxiety, better narrative, and also tangible things like more interviews.
Anna: Can you share a moment from coaching that increased your trust, something memorable?
Lisa: Yes. There was a session where I talked about internal politics. I was scared to say it, because it can be sensitive. Like, I told her about a situation where a senior person kind of blocked me from joining a product initiative. Not officially, but by saying, we need you in marketing now, stay in your lane. And I felt small and angry and also ashamed. And in the session, she did two things. First, she explicitly stated confidentiality. She said, I want you to know, this stays here, I do not work with your company, I do not know these people, and I will not share anything. And it was not like legal talk, it was calm. And I felt, okay, safe.
Anna: And the second thing?
Lisa: Second, she showed competence. She did not go into drama. She asked me to map stakeholders like a product launch. Who has power, who has interest, who could sponsor, what is the incentive. She was like, this is not personal, this is system. And then she gave me a script, like an exact wording for a conversation with my manager. In German, actually. Like, she said, you can say, Mir ist wichtig, meine Entwicklung Richtung Produkt zu gestalten, und ich moechte konkrete Schritte vereinbaren. Something like that. And it worked. I used a version of it, and my manager responded better than I expected. That session made me trust her deeply, because she held my vulnerability and turned it into action.
Anna: What was vulnerable about it for you?
Lisa: I felt I was whining. In consulting culture, you are supposed to be solution oriented. So admitting I felt blocked felt weak. And also, there is fear of being naive. Like, maybe I misunderstand. She helped me see it clearly without making me feel stupid.
Anna: Was there a moment where you felt stuck and the coach helped you reframe?
Lisa: Yes. I remember one session where I said, I do not know if I am even allowed to want this. It sounds crazy, but I was like, who am I to think I can be a PM? And she stopped me. She said, okay, pause. Where did you learn that you need permission? And I was like, eehm, maybe family, school, German culture, like do not be too ambitious. And she reframed it as: you are already doing parts of product work, you just do not have the title. She asked me to list evidence. Like, concrete things I did. And then she said, your job is not to be chosen by the market, your job is to present evidence and learn. It sounds simple, but it hit me.
Anna: How did you feel after that session?
Lisa: Lighter. Also more confident. Not like, I am the best, but like, okay, I can try. It reduced anxiety.
Anna: Have you ever had an experience where you trusted the coach, but it was not effective in that moment?
Lisa: Yes, actually. Early on. In the first or second session, she wanted to go very deep into values, like what do you want in life, and I was in panic mode. I needed tactical help. I trusted her as a person, she was kind and smart, but I left the session thinking, okay, this was nice but I still do not know what to do next week. So it was trusted but not effective for my immediate needs. Then I told her, and she adjusted. She said, okay, we balance depth and action. That also increased trust, because she adapted.
Anna: That is a useful distinction. And on the other side, have you had something effective but not fully trusted? We will also talk about AI later, but within human coaching first.
Lisa: Within human coaching, maybe in the beginning I was like, is she really the right person? Like, she gave me a template for a networking message. It was effective, because people responded. But I still did not fully trust the method yet, because I was like, maybe this is too salesy. So I used it, it worked, but trust was still building. Now it is different.
Anna: What helps trust build over time for you?
Lisa: Consistency. She shows up. She remembers details. She tracks my progress. Also empathy without being fuzzy. Like, she can say, that sounds hard, and also, here is what we do. And confidentiality. And competence, yes.
Anna: And effectiveness, how do you evaluate that for your situation?
Lisa: Effectiveness is like, do I have more clarity? Did I make decisions? Did I take concrete actions? Do I get interviews? Do I feel less anxious? Do I have a narrative that feels true and strong? Also, at work, I see results. Like, I present myself differently in stakeholder meetings now, more like product thinking, and people respond. That is effectiveness too.
Anna: Thank you.
5) AI tools experience and trust 
Anna: Now I want to shift to AI tools. What AI tools do you use for career related things, and how?
Lisa: I use, um, mostly ChatGPT. And sometimes a tool like Notion AI for structuring notes. Also Grammarly, but that is more writing. For career, it is mostly ChatGPT. I use it for project audits and structure. Like, after a week, I dump what I did, and I ask it to categorize my tasks into product-like competencies. I also ask it to rewrite bullet points, or to generate a structure for a case story. But deep work is only with a human.
Anna: When you say deep work, what does that mean?
Lisa: Deep work is like, what am I actually afraid of? What is my real decision? Also, very tailored narrative. Like, how do I combine my BCG marketing story with product? AI can give generic, but it does not know my context fully. And also, I have privacy boundaries.
Anna: Can you give an example of a moment AI helped with project audit or restructuring accomplishments?
Lisa: Yes. There was a time I had to update my CV and I was overwhelmed. I had like, 12 projects, and BCG marketing projects are messy, like many stakeholders, and you do a bit of everything. I wrote a raw list of tasks, very unstructured. I put it into ChatGPT and asked: group these into themes, and suggest strong action verbs, and propose metrics placeholders. And it returned a neat structure. It was not perfect, but it helped me see patterns. Like, I realized I do a lot of experimentation, A B testing in campaigns, and also stakeholder workshops. And then I could bring that to my coach. So AI was effective as a first pass.
Anna: What made it effective there?
Lisa:  Time. I mean speed of it. Seconds? And structure. It reduced cognitive load. It was like, okay, here is a draft. And then I can edit.
Anna: And can you describe a moment AI failed for you?
Lisa: Oh yes. Hahaha&. Many. One specific: I asked it to help me craft a story for why I want PM. I gave it my background, and it produced a very bland narrative, like, I am passionate about products and I want to leverage my marketing skills. It sounded like everyone. And it also assumed I had direct product ownership, like it wrote, led cross functional team to deliver product roadmap, which is not true. So I was like, no, that is dangerous. Also, it missed nuance. Like, my reason is partly emotional, partly about impact, partly about identity. It cannot capture that without a lot of back and forth.
Anna: Was there any privacy boundary moment?
Lisa: Yes and no at the same time. I hesitate to paste internal information. BCG has strict confidentiality. Even if I anonymize, I feel uneasy. So I keep it generic. And that makes the output more generic. But when I talk about myself i dont care. 
Anna: How does that affect your trust in AI tools?
Lisa:It can lower it but depends on the task. Like, I trust it for structure,t for deep personal or confidential context sometimes but not like super strongly. Also, I sometimes worry about wrong assumptions. It can sound confident while being wrong. So I try to always verify.
Anna: Do you ever use AI during the coaching process?
Lisa: Yes, between sessions. Like, after a coaching call, I use AI to summarize my action items, or to draft an email to a mentor, or to brainstorm interview questions. But I do not replace the coach with AI.
Anna: What would make you trust AI more in this domain?
Lisa: Clear boundaries. Like, if it says, I cannot know your context, here are options. Also, better personalization without needing me to share sensitive data. And, eehm, maybe transparency, like why it suggests something. But honestly, performance matters most. If it consistently gives me useful outputs, I trust more.
Anna: Thank you.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks
Anna: I want to compare human and AI through specific tasks. Let us take project audit first. If you had to choose, who is better for that, AI or your coach?
Lisa: AI is good for the first layer. Like, I dump tasks, it categorizes, it gives a structure. But my coach is better for meaning. She asks questions like, what did you decide, where did you influence, what was the impact. AI cannot ask the right follow ups in the same way, unless you prompt it very carefully. So, for project audit, I do both. AI for structure, human for interpretation.
Anna: What about rewriting CV and LinkedIn?
Lisa: AI can help with wording and variants. Like, give me three bullet options. That is helpful. But the coach is better for strategy. Like, what story do we want? What evidence do we highlight? How do we avoid overclaiming? She also knows market patterns. AI sometimes produces inflated language. In Germany, too much hype is a red flag. My coach catches that. She is like, do not sound like American sales. 
Anna: And job search strategy, like selecting roles, companies, and testing hypotheses?
Lisa: Coach. Because she helps me decide what to test first, and how to interpret results. AI can suggest a list of companies, but it does not know internal constraints, like which BCG unit is realistic for me, or which hiring manager values what. Also, in Munich, the product ecosystem is different from Berlin. AI can say, apply to startups, but my coach asks, do you want startup risk? What is your visa situation? What salary floor? Things like that.
Anna: And emotional support, confidence, dealing with anxiety?
Lisa: Human. No question. AI can say supportive words, but it does not feel real to me. I mean, no wait, let me rephrase. It can be comforting for a minute, like journaling. But trust is different. With my coach, I feel seen. And AI can be like it is processing me? Scanning my words? I dont know 
Anna: Can you explain what feeling processed means?
Lisa: Like, I input text, output comes. It is transactional. And sometimes it mirrors you, but you know it is a pattern. With my coach, she notices when I avoid something. She says, you laughed, why? She can sit with silence. AI fills silence with text. 
Anna: Any tasks where AI is clearly better?
Lisa: Brainstorming quickly. Like, give me 20 interview questions, or a checklist for product case interviews, or a structure for a portfolio. Also language polishing. And sometimes, it is effective because it is available at night. Like, at 23:00, when I am spiraling, I can dump thoughts. Not ideal, but it is there.
Anna: And any tasks where the coach is clearly better beyond emotional support?
Lisa: Negotiating identity. Like, the shift from marketing to product is not just tasks, it is who I am. Also politics. And accountability. I tell her I will do something, and then two weeks later she asks, did you do it? AI does not hold me accountable unless I set it up.
Anna: So there is a relational accountability?
Lisa: Yes.
Anna: If you think about a very concrete moment, can you describe a time you tried AI for something and it did not work, and then you brought it to the coach and it did work?
Lisa: Yes. I tried AI to craft a message to a senior person at BCG  to ask about internal transfer. AI gave me a very formal message, polite but generic. I sent something similar once and I got no reply. Then I told my coach, and she asked, what is your relationship, what is the context, what do you want exactly, what is in it for them. And then we crafted a message that was short, specific, and referenced a concrete shared project. And I got a reply within one day. So AI was ineffective because it lacked relational nuance. Coach was effective because she coached me on social dynamics.
Anna: That is helpful.
Anna: I want to do a quick short rating part, just to capture your current perceptions. It will take about a minute. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is complete trust, how would you rate your trust in human career coaches, in general?
Lisa: In general, I would say 8.
Anna: What makes it an 8 and not a 10?
Lisa: Because coaches vary. There are many on the market, and some are not good, or they overpromise. So general trust is not 10. But I believe a good human coach can be trustworthy because of empathy, confidentiality, and experience. That is why it is high.
Anna: And trust in AI tools for career support, 0 to 10?
Lisa: Maybe 5.
Anna: Why 5?
Lisa: Because I trust it for structure and drafts, but I do not trust it for nuance, confidentiality, and sometimes accuracy. It can hallucinate, like assume things. So it is mid.
Anna: Perceived effectiveness of human coaching for your situation, 0 to 10?
Lisa: For my situation, I would say 9.
Anna: Why 9?
Lisa: Because it actually moves me forward. I have actions, I have interviews, I have confidence. The only reason it is not 10 is because it is expensive, and also because not every session is a breakthrough. Sometimes it is maintenance.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10?
Lisa: 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Lisa: It helps a lot with speed and structure. It is effective for certain tasks. But it cannot replace the human work, so sex. 
Anna: Thank you, that is very clear.
7) Trust-effectiveness link
Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human coaching, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Lisa: Trust is like the door. If I do not trust the coach, I will not share the real problem. And then they cannot help. Like, if I hide the messy parts, like insecurity, politics, fear, then the coach can only work on surface things, like CV wording. So trust enables depth. And depth makes it effective.
Anna: What are the main drivers of trust for you in a human coach?
Lisa: Competence. Like, do they understand my context, corporate, consulting pace, German market. Empathy, but not pity. Confidentiality, explicitly stated and felt. Structure, like a process. And feeling seen, like she remembers details, she catches patterns.
Anna: And what are your indicators that coaching is effective?
Lisa: Clarity, decisions, action. Like, I decide, okay, I will target PMM roles for two months and build a portfolio, then reassess. Or I decide to have a conversation with my manager. Also external indicators, like callbacks, interviews, response rates. And internal indicators, like less anxiety, more confidence, better narrative. And even at work, like I take more ownership, I speak in a different way, and stakeholders respond.
Anna: Can you think of a moment when trust was present but effectiveness was low, besides the early values session you mentioned?
Lisa: Yes. There was a session recently where I was very tired. BCG had a big push, and I was burned out. I trusted her, but I could not implement anything. So the session felt like, okay, we talked, but nothing moved. And then she noticed and said, maybe the effective thing now is rest. So the definition of effectiveness changed. But in the moment, I was like, not effective.
Anna: That is interesting, effectiveness depends on capacity.
Lisa: Exactly.
Anna: And can you think of a moment where something was effective but you did not fully trust it?
Lisa: That is mostly AI. Like, AI gave me a very good structure for a portfolio outline. It was effective because it saved time and it looked professional. But I did not fully trust it because I was like, is this actually the right thing for German PM interviews? Or is it generic i dont know silicon valley stuff. So I used it, but I needed validation from my coach.
Anna: So you can separate usefulness from trust?
Lisa: Yes. Usefulness can be high even when trust is not high. It is like, I can take the output as a draft, but I do not let it decide for me.
Anna: In your experience, does trust always lead to effectiveness?
Lisa: Not always. It increases the chance. Like, if I trust my coach, I will do the work and I will share more. But effectiveness also depends on timing and method. Like if I am burned out, even the best coach will not create miracles.
Anna: And can something be effective without trust, or with low trust?
Lisa: Yes, for small tasks. Like, if a person gives me a good template, I can use it. But for big decisions, I need trust. Otherwise I resist. I either do not follow through or I keep it superficial.
Anna: How do you notice in yourself that trust is missing?
Lisa: I become performative. Like I speak in polished phrases. Very BCG. ] I present a story instead of the truth. And I do not mention the parts that feel messy. That is when I know trust is not there.
Anna: aha and in human coaching, what did your coach do that made you not feel you had to be performative?
Lisa: She normalizes. She says, it is okay to not know. And she also uses silence. Like, if I say something and then I laugh, she waits and says, what is behind the laugh. That is uncomfortable but it makes it real. And also she shares structure. Like, okay, today we do audit, then we do narrative, then we do next steps. So I feel held.
Anna: Does confidentiality come up explicitly in your coaching relationship?
Lisa: Yes. In the first session she explained how she handles notes, what she stores, that she does not share anything. And then later, when I brought up sensitive internal stuff, she repeated it in a natural way. Not like legal text, but like, this is your safe space, I do not work with BCG, nothing leaves here. That matters.
Anna: Is there anything that could break trust quickly for you?
Lisa: Hm i guess if she would judge me. Like, if she says, why are you complaining, or you should just be grateful. That would break it. Also if she would push me into a decision that benefits her, like keeping me as a client, or if she would promise unrealistic outcomes. And if she would share even a small detail that makes me feel exposed. But that has not happened.
Anna: When you think of AI tools, do you have trust drivers there too, or is it different?
Lisa: It is different. AI trust drivers are more like, does it give consistent output, does it respect constraints, does it avoid inventing. And also, does it keep my data safe, but I cannot really verify that. So I rely on my own boundary.
Anna: So you manage trust by controlling what you input?
Lisa: Exactly. Like i do not paste internal numbers. I do not paste names. I keep it general. And then I accept that the output is general.
Anna: That if you had to describe the trust effectiveness link in one sentence for your situation, how would you say it?
Lisa: Trust allows me to be honest, and honesty makes the coaching effective. For AI, usefulness is separate from trust, because it can be useful without being relationally trustworthy.
Anna: alright. Let us move to comparing human and AI directly via tasks.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction
Anna: Imagine you have three tasks this week like one doing a project audit of your last two weeks, two, rewriting a LinkedIn section to be more product oriented, and three, preparing for a tough career conversation with your manager. For each task, which support would you choose and why?
Lisa: Okay. Project audit, I would start with AI. Because I can dump everything and get structure fast. Then I bring it to my coach for refinement.
Anna: Why not directly with the coach?
Lisa: Because coach time is expensive and limited. And also, AI can do the messy first pass without me feeling judged. Then I come to the coach with something more organized.
Anna: And rewriting LinkedIn?
Lisa: Both. AI for options, like three versions, different tones. But the coach for strategy, like what positioning is credible for me in Germany and within BCG context. Also she catches when it sounds too inflated.
Anna: And the career conversation with your manager?
Lisa: Only human. I would not use AI for that beyond maybe drafting the email follow up. But the core conversation prep needs a human. Because it is emotional, political, and I need to anticipate reactions. AI can give generic scripts, but it cannot read the relationship dynamics.
Anna: What makes you say relationship dynamics is crucial?
Lisa: Because my manager is supportive but also under pressure. If I push too hard, she might shut down. If I am too vague, nothing changes. My coach helps me find the right balance. She asks, what does your manager care about, what can you offer, what is a small ask. That is nuanced.
Anna: If you think about hybrid models, some providers imagine AI as a coach that chats with you daily, and then a human coach occasionally. How do you react to that?
Lisa: My first reaction is, hmm, no. Daily AI coaching feels like noise. I would use it like a journal, but I would not call it coaching. Coaching for me is depth, not frequency.
Anna: What would be your ideal hybrid setup?
Lisa: AI as a preparation and follow up assistant, like collecting my data, making a summary, tracking my experiment metrics, reminding me of action steps. Then human sessions every two weeks for deep work, decisions, and accountability. That is ideal.
Anna: What would you want AI to do specifically between sessions?
Lisa: It could help me do a weekly audit. Like, what did you do, what are outcomes, what are blockers, what is next. And it could generate drafts: networking messages, CV bullet variants, interview question lists. Also maybe a small tracker: which roles I applied to, response rates, and patterns. Like, if PM roles at certain companies respond more, that is data.
Anna: And what do you not want AI to do?
Lisa: Interpret my emotions. Or give me therapy style responses. And I do not want it to pretend it understands my life. I want clear boundaries. Also I do not want it to store sensitive data. If it has memory, I would be cautious.
Anna: If we take a step further: imagine a system where AI suggests a career decision, like you should choose internal transfer over external. Would you accept that?
Lisa: No, I would not accept it as decision. I might accept it as a set of options. Like, here are pros and cons. But the decision has to be mine, and ideally discussed with a human, because it involves values and risk.
Anna: What kind of risk?
Lisa: Financial, because coaching and job search take time. Also identity risk. Like leaving BCG brand. And in Germany, job changes are sometimes judged. Not always, but there is still a cultural thing of stability. Also practical things like location. Berlin is exciting but chaotic, Munich is stable but maybe less startup. So it is not a pure optimization problem.
Anna: That is interesting. If you imagine AI tools becoming much better at personalization and context, would that change your preference?
Lisa: It would change it partially. If AI could truly understand my context without me sharing sensitive data, and if it could challenge me like a good coach, then maybe. But I still think human presence matters. Like, when I am stuck, I need a person to look at me and say, I see you, and I believe you can do it, and also, you are avoiding the real issue. AI can imitate that, but it will not feel real to me. So I think I will always want some human element.
Anna: What if the human element was a group format, like group coaching, and AI handles individual prep?
Lisa: That could work. Group coaching can be cheaper. And hearing other people also reduces shame. Like, you realize everyone is struggling. And AI could handle the repetitive parts. But I would still want at least some one to one time for my specific situation, because internal BCG politics are very specific.
Anna: Thank you. That covers hybrid preferences nicely. Let us go to the last blocks. We already discussed trust and effectiveness as separate, but I want to ask you to reflect on the link more directly for AI versus human, and then we close.
9) Closing 
Anna: As we wrap up, if you think about your own journey from marketing toward product, what do you think has changed most due to human coaching, and what has changed due to AI tools?
Lisa: Human coaching changed my identity narrative. Like, I stopped seeing myself as only marketing. I started seeing product thinking inside what I do. It also changed my behavior. I take more ownership, I speak differently. And it reduced my anxiety. AI tools changed my execution speed. Like i can create drafts faster, I can structure my thoughts, I can get unstuck on small tasks.
Anna: If you had to give one advice to someone similar to you, early career in Germany, wanting to switch into product, what would you say about trust and effectiveness in the support they choose?
Lisa: I would say, choose support that you trust enough to be honest. Because if you hide, you will not get the help you need. And effectiveness is not just motivation, it is concrete actions and feedback loops. If a coach or tool does not lead to actions, you will stay stuck. 
Anna: Anything you would like to add that we did not cover?
Lisa: No
Anna: Thank you, Lisa. I will stop the recording now.




Laura 


1) Opening and consent


Anna: Hi Laura, thanks for joining. Before we start, I want to check a few things. Is it okay for you that I am recording this interview for transcription purposes? I wont share the recording, only the transcript, everything will be anonymized.


Laura: Yes, this is fine.


Anna: Great. And just to confirm, you can skip any question, and you can stop the interview at any time, no explanation needed. Okay?


Laura: Yes, sounds good.


Anna: Perfect. Also, for context, I am interested in how early career people experience trust and perceived effectiveness in different kinds of career support, including AI tools and human coaching. There are no right or wrong answers. I may ask follow up questions, just to understand your perspective. Any questions before we begin?


Laura: No


Anna: Great. Can you briefly introduce yourself in the way you would if someone asked you at a networking event? Just whatever feels natural.


Laura: Um, okay. I am Laura, I am 25, I live in Munich. I did my Bachelor in Aerospace, finished two years ago. I started a Master after that, and eehm, I am kind of in the middle of a pivot. I am trying to get into something like cloud engineering, platform stuff, ideally in a startup.I was born in Spain, but I moved to Germany when I was seven, so I grew up here.


Anna: Thanks. We will go step by step. Let us move to your current situation.


2) Participant context and career situation


Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now?


Laura: Eehm, so right now I am in a Master program at TUM. I started it because I thought I wanted research, like the classic path, you know, Bachelor, then Master, then maybe PhD, maybe a research institute. That was like the plan in my head. But then I started and I was like, no. Like, no wait, let me rephrase. Not that the topic is bad, but the environment and the daily life of research, it felt so slow and kind of isolated.


Anna: Aha, i understand. When you say slow and isolated, what do you mean by that?


Laura: Like, weeks of reading papers, meetings where everyone speaks in very careful language, a lot of, um, how to say ehm i dont remember the word nevermind. I realized I get energy from shipping something, from seeing impact, from being in a team that builds and moves. Research can have impact, obviously, but it felt like I was always preparing for impact.


Anna: So what is the decision you are facing now?


Laura: The main decision is basically do I finish the Master as it is, or do I kind of reframe it to support the pivot. I am attracted to startups, but I also see the risk, like stability, visa stuff does not apply to me because I have German citizenship, but still, rent in Munich is not funny. And also language expectations. Like my German is fluent, but in tech jobs a lot is English, and then some companies still want German for internal stuff. It is like, okay, where do I fit best.


Anna: If you think about the last 6 to 12 months, what was the most significant moment or turning point in your thinking?


Laura: There was one moment, yes. I was doing a research project, like a lab project, at a chair that works with simulations. It was not even a bad chair, the people were fine. But we had this meeting, and I presented some results, and the professor was like, yes, interesting, but now you need to validate it with more literature, and then maybe in three months we can think about a workshop paper. And I remember walking out and feeling physically heavy. I was like, is this my life. Another three months for a workshop paper that maybe five people read. And then, in the same week, I went to an event at Unternehmer TUM, and it was so different. People spoke about actual products, customers, costs, scaling. And I was like, oh. This is where my brain feels something good.


Anna: Tell me about that UnternehmerTUM event. What kind of event was it, and what did you take away?


Laura: It was at the Unternehmertum building, like this startup hub vibe. I think it was a talk plus networking. The topic was something like platform strategy or infrastructure, maybe not exactly those words, but it was about building reliable systems for growth. There was someone from a Munich startup, not like a huge сompany, more like Series A or something, and they explained how they migrated from a messy setup to a more structured platform approach. They talked about things like monitoring, incident response, and how that affects customer trust. And I was like, wow, this is engineering that sits directly next to business outcomes. Like, if you do it well, the company can move faster, and customers are happy, and you avoid downtime.


Anna: Did something specific stick in your mind from that talk?


Laura: Yes. They said something like, platform engineering is not about tools, it is about enabling teams. Like internal customers. And they described building a self service platform where dev teams can deploy without waiting for permission. And I was like, that is basically reducing friction, like a product, but interna. And I think that connected to me because I like systems. Aerospace is also systems, but in aerospace it is often slow with heavy compliance, long cycles. Here it is faster.


Anna: So after that, what did you do? Did you take concrete steps?


Laura: I did. i started exploring what roles exist, like cloud engineer, DevOps, SRE, platform engineer. I realized the titles are messy. And also  started learning more practically. I did a basic cloud certification prep, like AWS Cloud Practitioner first, and then I started looking at Solutions Architect Associate, but that one is heavy. And then I also tried some labs with Terraform and Docker. Not super advanced, but enough to see if I like it.


Anna: And where are you now with the Master? You said you are in the middle of a pivot.


Laura: I am still enrolled. I have finished most core modules. I chose some electives that are more software or systems oriented. I also took one entrepreneurship or management course, because I want to be closer to business. For the thesis, I am trying to find a topic that is not purely aerospace research, maybe something like cloud infrastructure for simulation pipelines, or reliability in engineering tools, something bridging.I am also applying for internships in startups, but it is competitive.


Anna: What makes it difficult right now for you?


Laura: Hm, uncertainty? Identity issues too. Like, my CV says aerospace. People assume I want aerospace. And then I say, no, I want platform engineering, and they are like, why. And sometimes I feel like I am betraying my past self, you know. But also I think it is normal to change. Also the job descriptions are crazy. Entry level but they want three years of Kubernetes, and then also German, and then also on call experience. I am like, okay, sure hahaha.


Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed during this period?


Laura: I dont know 


Anna: Like what did you want someone experienced to tell you?


Laura: Ah, okay, like maybe what is the path, what are the steps, how do I present the story. Also accountability maybe. But I hate the idea of someone telling me who I am. I need support but also that does not mean i am lost. 


Anna: You mean you want to be in charge? 


Laura: Yes. 


Anna: Understood. Let us move to career support in general.


3) Career support in general


Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?


Laura: To myself, like journaling. Can use AI, like ChatGPT, for structured reflection. Then sometimes I talk to friends who work in tech. I also talk to my boyfriend, but he is not in tech, so it is more emotional support. And I sometimes ask professors for practical things, but not career coaching, more like, can you recommend a course, can you connect me to someone. And also I go to events, like meetups, UnternehmerTUM, sometimes TUM career events, to just hear what exists.


Anna: When you talk to friends, what do you ask them?


Laura: Very concrete questions. Like, what do you actually do as a platform engineer. What skills do you use daily. How did you get your first job. How do interviews look. And I trust that more because it is grounded. Not like, follow your passion, and the universe will deliver. That kind of stuff makes me angry hahaha. 


Anna: What has actually helped, and what felt unhelpful or frustrating?


Laura: Helpful is when someone gives me a mental model or a concrete step. Like, do one certification, build one small project, write about it, apply to these roles, tailor CV like this. Also helpful is when someone says, this is hard, but normal. Unhelpful is vague advice or commodified empathy. Like, people who sell feelings. Also, anything that feels like influencer culture, like, buy my product, I will tell you your purpose. That is, um, no.


Anna: You mentioned professors. Have you had any mentoring type relationship?


Laura: In a way, yes. I had one lecturer who was very honest about industry. He worked in Airbus before academia. When I said I am thinking about leaving research, he did not judge, he said, okay, then you need to optimize for learning speed, go where you can do stuff. That felt like mentoring. But it was not a paid coach situation. 


Anna: If you had to list what you need most from any form of support, what are the top two or three things?


Laura: Structure, realism, and maybe a mirror. Like reflecting my own thoughts back so I can see them.


Anna: A mirror? interesting. We will come back to that. Now I want to focus specifically on human career coaching, even if you have not used it.
4) Human coaching experience and trust 


Anna: Have you ever used human career coaching consultations, for example university career services or private coaching?


Laura: No. And I do not want to. I know that sounds harsh. But I have a strong negative view.


Anna: That is okay. Can you tell me what your expectations are, and why you feel negative about it?


Laura: Eehm. I think coaching as an industry is full of nonsense. Like, people who have no real skills, but they learned how to talk, and they package common sense as a product. And in Germany especially, there is this thing where people use titles and certifications to sound serious. But then they tell you very generic things. And they charge like 150 euros per hour for talking. And I have seen friends being manipulated. Like, someone tells them, your fear is blocking you, invest in yourself, and then they buy more sessions. It feels like a scam ecosystem.


Anna: When you say manipulated, what happened to your friends?


Laura: One friend from my Bachelor, she was very anxious about jobs. She went to a coach she found on Better Go or something like that . The coach told her that she has limiting beliefs and she needs to commit to a package of three sessions, otherwise she will not change. And my friend paid, and after three sessions she felt worse, because she felt like she is failing the coaching too. And the advice was like, visualize your future, write affirmations. That is not what she needed. She needed interview prep and a plan. So I watched that and I was like, nope.


Anna: That sounds like a specific style of coaching. Do you make a difference between that and, for example, a coach provided by a university career center? Like a sound career coach, not just a coach?


Laura: Hmm. Maybe. I know TUM has career services, and those people are probably more grounded. I still have skepticism, but I can imagine they might help with CV formatting or general guidance. But I think the private coaching market ruined the concept for me. Also, I do not like the power dynamic. Like, I sit there and someone pretends to know my life better than me.


Anna: What do you think a human career coach would do in a session, if you imagine it?


Laura: They would ask me about my values, my strengths, maybe some tests. Then they would tell me I can do anything.


Anna: Jokes aside there can be like this sometimes yes. 


Laura: Yes. And then maybe they would help with LinkedIn. But I think for complex situations, they do not have the context. Like, they do not know the technical landscape, they do not know what a platform engineer actually does. Unless they are specialized. 


Anna: What would make you trust a human career coach, hypothetically? If you think of trust drivers.


Laura: Competence, obviously. Like proven experience in the domain. Not just talking. Also honesty about limits. If someone says, I do not know, that increases trust. Also not pushing packages. And maybe references. Like if someone I respect recommends them. But in general, my baseline is low.


Anna: What about affective aspects, like empathy, feeling understood?


Laura: I do not want empathy from a stranger that I pay. It feels fake. Like, I know they are being nice because it is their job. Maybe that is unfair, but that is how it feels. I prefer empathy from friends. For career decisions, I prefer competence and a plan.


Anna: You said earlier you need a mirror. Some people see a coach as a mirror. What makes that different for you?


Laura: Because the coach mirror comes with interpretation. And I do not trust their interpretation. If I want a mirror, I want something that reflects my words and helps me structure, but does not impose a narrative. That is actually why I like AI, because it is basically me and my answers and model of thinking. 


Anna: You said baseline trust is low. Can you give a number? I will ask you a few quick ratings later, but we can start here. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is complete trust, what is your trust in human career coaches, in general?


Laura: For private career coaches, maybe 1. For something like university career services, maybe 3. But if you ask one number, overall, I would say 2.


Anna: And why 2, not 0?


Laura: Because I know there are probably some good people. And also sometimes even generic advice can trigger something. Like, you hear something obvious and you finally do it. So not zero. But yeah, very low.


Anna: aha cool thank you. We will revisit effectiveness separately. For now, I want to move to AI tools, where you said you have real experience.


5)  AI tools experience and trust


Anna: Which AI based tools have you used for career related questions, and what was your experience?


Laura: Mostly ChatGPT. Also sometimes Perplexity for searching, but the main is ChatGPT because it is conversational. I use it like a thinking partner. Like self coaching. I open it and I basically talk to it like I talk to myself, but it responds with structure.


Anna: Can you walk me through a concrete situation where you used it?


Laura: Yes. When I realized I might not want research, I was confused. I felt guilty, like I wasted time. So I wrote a long message describing my situation, what I liked, what I hated, what I feared. And I asked it to help me map options. Not like telling me what to do, but like making a decision framework. It responded with categories, like values, constraints, experiments. It suggested doing small experiments, like attending events, doing a small cloud project, talking to people. And that actually helped me because it made it actionable instead of emotional chaos.


Anna: What does trust mean for you when it comes to ChatGPT?


Laura: Trust is different. I do not trust it as truth. I trust it as a tool for reflection. So I trust that it will give me a structured response and not judge me. And I trust that it will be available and consistent. I do not trust that it is always accurate about facts. And I do not trust it with personal data, like very sensitive details. I keep some boundaries.


Anna: What boundaries for example?


Laura: I do not tell it names of companies I am applying to, or personal details about family, or things that could identify me. I keep it more abstract. And if I paste something like my CV, I remove contact data. And I do not tell it like private conflicts. Maybe some, but not too deep.


Anna: You said you use it for self coaching. How exactly do you do that? Is it like daily, weekly?


Laura: It depends. In intense phases, I use it almost daily. Like when I am applying for jobs, I use it to rewrite bullet points, to prepare for interviews, to draft messages, to simulate questions. In calmer phases, maybe once a week, like check in.


Anna: Can you give an example of a prompt, without quoting it directly, just describing what you asked?


Laura: Sure. I asked something like: here is my background in aerospace, here is why I want platform engineering, help me craft a narrative that does not sound random, and give me three versions, one for a startup recruiter, one for a corporate, and one for networking. And also highlight gaps and how to address them. That kind of thing.


Anna: And what did it produce that was useful?


Laura: It gave me a structure: past, pivot trigger, present actions, future goal. It also suggested specific phrases to connect aerospace systems thinking with platform reliability. That was helpful. It also listed gaps like lack of production experience, and suggested ways to compensate, like personal projects, open source contributions, internships.


Anna: What do you see as the main reasons you trust it more than a human coach?


Laura:  It is not trying to sell me anything.I am already paying for premium though hahaha. At least it feels like that. It  is consistent and fast also it does not judge. And what i like specifically is that it can adapt to my style. Like, if I say, be more direct, it does it. A human coach might be like, hmm, let us explore your childhood. No thanks.


Anna: And what makes you distrust it, or trust it conditionally?


Laura: It can write complete cringe. Like, it can confidently say wrong things. That is a problem. Also it can be basic. Sometimes it gives advice that is like the same that the selling coach gives like, network more, learn skills, be confident. And I am like, okay, thanks. Also privacy. And also it sometimes assumes things about me.


Anna: Can you describe a specific moment where it failed in a way that mattered?


Laura: Yes. I asked about a specific certification path and job requirements in Germany. It recommended a certain certification that is more US focused, and it also said some companies require it, but when I checked, it was not true. It sounded plausible, but it was not accurate for startups in DACH. And also once I asked about salary ranges, and it gave numbers that felt inflated i think. 


Anna: Did that reduce your trust?


Laura: It reduced trust overall but i already knew it is not to be trusted. So yes but no in the reflection function. Like, I still trust it to help me think, but I do not trust it to be a source of truth.


Anna: If we do a quick rating: on 0 to 10, what is your trust in AI tools like ChatGPT for your career related needs?


Laura: Hmm. I would say 7.


Anna: Why 7, not 9?


Laura: Because of hallucinations and privacy. And because it lacks real world accountability. Like, it can say anything, and nothing happens to it. So I keep it at 7.


Anna: Why 7, not 4?


Laura: Because it is actually useful and consistent. It has helped me a lot. So it earned trust through experience.


Anna: Great. Now I want to compare human and AI via tasks, because your thesis topic is about differences across tasks.


6) Human vs AI comparison via tasks


Anna: If you think about specific career tasks, which ones would you prefer AI for, and which ones would you prefer a human for, and why?


Laura: AI for brainstorming options, structuring plans, rewriting CV bullet points, cover letters, preparing interview answers, explaining concepts, giving learning roadmaps. Also for practicing, like mock interview questions. Human for specific mentoring, like someone who actually works as a platform engineer telling me what matters. Also maybe emotional support, but not from a coach, more from friends. And maybe for negotiation or reading a room?


Anna: Let us pick one task. Clarifying options. If you were deciding between staying in research and going to business, how would AI and humans differ?


Laura: AI helped me create a matrix. Like, criteria and scoring. Humans often give opinions. Like, do what makes you happy. Or they project their own fears. AI felt more neutral. But it can miss context, like cultural stuff, family expectations.


Anna: Family expectations, can you tell me a bit about that?


Laura: My parents are Spanish, but they live here. They are hardworking, and they value stable careers. Aerospace sounds prestigious to them. Research sounds prestigious too. Startup cloud engineer sounds like, what is that. So there is this pressure to not waste the degree. They are not controlling, but they worry. And also in Spanish culture there is a bit of, you have difficulties, you do not jump around too much. So part of me is like, I should just finish and go to Airbus. And part of me is like, no, I want something else. AI cannot fully understand that emotional layer, but it can help me articulate it.


Anna: And decision making? Do you think AI can support decisions effectively?


Laura: It can support the process but I don't think it can decide. But it can break down the decision. It can suggest experiments. A human can also do that, but again, depends on the person.


Anna: Can you give an example where AI gave you a plan you actually followed?


Laura: Hm. Yes. I asked for a 12 week learning plan for some role, assuming I have 10 hours per week, and I want to be ready for internships. It gave me weeks, topics, small projects. I followed it partly. Like not perfectly, but it made me start. Without that, I would just be overwhelmed and would look for info in websites? I dont know even how people did that before chat GPT


Anna: What about CV and applications?


Laura: AI is great there. Like, you paste a bullet point, it makes it stronger. But you need to check truthfulness, because it sometimes exaggerates. It can add things like led cross functional team, and I am like, no. So you need to control it.


Anna: You said human mentoring could be valuable. That is interesting given your strong rejection of coaching. Can you clarify the difference for you?


Laura: Yes. Mentoring is anchored in real experience. Like, a senior engineer telling me what they do. Coaching feels like someone selling a method. Mentoring is not trying to transform your soul. It is like, here is reality. And I respect that.


Anna: If you imagine a human career coach who is actually specialized, like someone who used to be a platform engineer and now coaches people into that field, would that change anything?


Laura: Maybe. It would increase competence trust. But I still dislike the vibe of coaching. I would rather just talk to an engineer. But, okay, I can imagine for some people it helps to have a structured human guiding them, especially if they lack self discipline.


Anna: So there is a thing. For you, if i understood correctly, the label coaching is the problem, and the market practices? 


Laura: I guess yes. 


Anna: Now I want to ask explicitly about trust and effectiveness as separate concepts. Sometimes people say, I trust something but it does not help, or I do not trust it but it still helps. Do you have examples of that?


7) Trust-effectiveness link


Laura: Yes. I think low trust but usefulI once attended a career talk, not at TUM, like a general career seminar. I did not trust the speaker because they were very salesy. But they shared one framework for telling your story in interviews, like situation, task, action, result. That was useful. Even though I disliked them, I took the framework and used it. So effectiveness can exist without trust. 


Anna: Aha. Thank you. And high trust but limited effectiveness?


Laura: Probably also yes with AI  i trust ChatGPT to brainstorm and not judge me. But it cannot fully capture emotions. Like, sometimes I ask, why do I feel stuck, and it gives a reasonable answer, but it does not feel like being seen by a human. It is like cognitive empathy, not real. So I trust it to be supportive, but it does not always change how I feel. It helps me think, but not always feel better.


Anna: So in your mind, trust and effectiveness are linked but not identical.


Laura: Seems to me like so yes. But like  if I do not trust something, I might not use it. But sometimes you still use it because it is convenient. Like, I do not trust social media influencers, but sometimes I still watch a clip and get that blush from a tiktok shop you know. And effectiveness is about what came after. Like outcome or end goal was reached or not. 


Anna: If you think about the way trust affects effectiveness for you, what is the mechanism?


Laura: If I trust the source, I invest more attention, I follow through. If I distrust, I keep distance, I might still take small pieces. So trust affects depth of engagement.


Anna: Thank you. Now I want to do the short micro poll ratings, just to anchor the conversation. We already did two, but we will do all four clearly. I will ask, and you give a number and a short explanation.


Laura: Okay.


Anna: On a scale from 0 to 10, your trust in human career coaches.


Laura: 2. Because I associate it with a market of vague advice and sales tactics. I think some are okay, but I start skeptical.


Anna:On a scale from 0 to 10, your trust in AI tools like ChatGPT for career support.


Laura: 7. Because it is consistent and helpful for structure, but it can hallucinate and there are privacy limits.


Anna: Perceived effectiveness of human career coaching for your situation, hypothetical, 0 to 10.


Laura: For me personally, maybe 3. It could help with generic things like CV review, but I do not think it would help with my real pivot decisions. Unless the person is very specialized.


Anna: Why 3, not 6?


Laura: Because I would resist it. I would sit there and internally argue. So even if it is good, it would not work on me. Also cost. I would feel annoyed paying for it.


Anna: Fourth: Perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, based on your experience, 0 to 10.


Laura: 8.


Anna: Why 8, not 10?


Laura: Because of factual unreliability and because it cannot replace real world mentorship and emotional depth. But it is very effective for planning, preparation, and clarity.






Anna: You mentioned earlier that you believe everyone should find their own path through difficulty? Can you explain that belief a bit?


Laura: Eehm, yes. I think struggle is part of building a real identity. If someone tells you what to do, you borrow their certainty. But it is not yours. And then when it gets hard, you collapse. Whereas if you fight through confusion, you build internal trust. That sounds dramatic. But I feel it. Like, I moved countries as a kid, I learned languages, I had to adapt. That taught me that discomfort is normal. So when I see coaching that promises easy clarity, I distrust it. Life is messy.


Anna: Wow that is cool.  Is there any scenario where you would accept paid human support?


Laura: If it is technical mentorship, like paying for a session with a senior cloud engineer to review my project or my approach. That is basically consulting. I would pay for expertise.


Anna: So it is not the money itself, it is what you pay for.


Laura: Exactly.


8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction


Anna: Imagine a hybrid model that combines AI for structured reflection and preparation, and then human experts for targeted sessions, for example to validate your plan, give industry context, or help with a key decision. How do you react to that idea?


Laura: That sounds more reasonable. Because AI can do the repetitive stuff, and human time is used for high value expertise. But I would want the human to be an insider, like actually working in the field, not a generic coach.


Anna: What would make you trust such a hybrid service?


Laura: Transparency about who the human is. Like their real job, background also clear boundaries what AI does, what human does. And no emotional manipulation. Like, do not tell me, invest in yourself or you are blocked.Also pricing that feels fair. Like pay per session, not a package trap.


Anna: What would make you not use it?


Laura: If it feels like coaching culture. Or if the AI part collects too much data. Or if the matching feels random. Like, if you match me to someone who is not relevant, I will lose trust immediately.


Anna: Would you want AI to be involved during the human session, like summarizing, creating action steps?


Laura: That could be helpful. Like after the session, AI could turn notes into a plan. But I would want control. And I would want to know what data is stored.


Anna: If you think about tasks, which tasks would you assign to AI and which to the human in this hybrid?


Laura: pre work, self reflection, draft CV, draft interview answers, learning plan, tracking applications to ai probably. To human: reality check, feedback on my narrative, technical roadmap validation, maybe mock interview with real feedback, and advice about market, like which startups or companies are good.


Anna: In such a model, where would trust matter most?


Laura: Trust matters most with the human, because they can influence my decisions and they are a real person with incentives. AI is more like a tool. I need trust in the system to not harm me, but it is different.


Anna: And effectiveness?


Laura: Effectiveness depends on whether it produces action and outcomes. Like, do I get interviews, do I feel clearer, do I build skills. AI already helps with that. Human could increase it if they are truly relevant.


Anna: If you had to design the perfect support experience for yourself, what would it look like in one paragraph?


Laura: I would have a space to think, like AI conversation, where I can dump thoughts and get structure. Then maybe once a month a session with a real platform engineer who reviews my progress and gives me realistic feedback. And maybe a community or meetup for networking, but not forced. Like optional.


Anna: Thank you. Before we close, I want to check if there is anything we missed about your experience with AI that feels important, especially around trust.


Laura: No 


Anna: Thank you. Great. Laura this is  the end of the interview. After this, I will stop the recording. If you have any questions later, you can message me in insta or whatsapp i give you 


















Oleg 
1) Opening and consent


Anna: Hi Oleg. Thanks for joining today. Before we start, do I have your permission to record this interview?


Oleg: Yes, you have my permission.


Anna: Great. Just to repeat the basics: everything is anonymous, you can skip any question, and you can stop at any time. Does that feel okay?


Oleg: Yes, that is fine.


Anna: Good. And one more thing: I will ask about your experiences with human career support and also AI tools. There is no right answer. I am interested in your honest experience. Any topics you would prefer not to discuss today?


Oleg: I don’t want to say the exact company name. But otherwise it is fine.


Anna: Perfect. We will keep it general and if something feels too specific, we can just rephrase. This interview will take about 45 minutes is it fine?


Oleg: Yes, yes. I am at home.


Anna: Great. Then I will start with some context questions.


2)  Participant context and career situation


Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing, or recently faced?


Oleg: So I am 25, I live in Germany now, for four years. I finished my Master two years ago, here in Germany. I work as a data analyst in a big transportation company. Like, buses, trains, logistics, mobility, that kind of thing. And I like data analytics a lot. I like when you take messy data and make something useful. But eehm, recently, I feel a bit lost about the next step.


Anna: When you say lost, what do you mean exactly?


Oleg: Like, I know I am good as an individual contributor. I can do all IT stuff, dashboards, stakeholder requests. But I want to develop towards management. I want to lead a team eventually, maybe manage an analytics unit. And I do not know i see some people become team leads, but it feels like договорняк как бы. Also there is German corporate culture, and you know.


Anna: Yes i know. What makes it feel like that договорняк you mentioned?


Oleg: There are like official career steps, job levels, all these frameworks. But in reality, you need sponsors, you need someone to say, okay, Oleg can lead. And I don’t know what exactly they look for. Sometimes I think, maybe I should switch to product analytics somewhere else, or maybe consulting, but I do not know. So I feel stuck between wanting leadership and not knowing how to move.


Anna: What is your current role like day to day?


Oleg: I am in a corporate analytics unit, like central reporting. We support different business areas, operations, punctuality, customer experience, finance controlling. So a typical week, I have stakeholder meetings, they want some KPI, some report for a board update, or for a performance review cycle. I work with data pipelines, but we also have data engineers. I mostly do analysis and dashboards. We use Power BI mainly, sometimes Tableau in some legacy teams, and I do Python for deep dives. And SQL daily, yes. A lot of SQL.


Anna: And what does leadership mean to you in this environment?


Oleg: Um, it is not only having people reporting to you. It is like owning a domain. Saying no to stakeholders. Helping juniors. Translating business questions into analytics. And also, eehm, protecting the team from chaos? Because in big company, everyone wants something yesterday.


Anna: What is the most significant career decision you have made in the last 6 to 12 months?


Oleg: Hmm. I think the biggest was whether to apply for an internal team lead position in another department. There was an opening, not in my team, but in a business unit analytics team. A colleague sent me the link and said, you should try. And I was like, wow, okay, but I am young, and also not native German speaker. And it was a leadership role. I was not sure if I am ready.


Anna: What did you do in the end?


Oleg: I did not apply. And I feel mixed about it. On one hand, maybe it was not the right role. It was very stakeholder heavy, and the team was under pressure. On the other hand, I think I blocked myself. Like страх, fear. And then I started to think, okay, how do I prepare for leadership if I always wait until I feel 100 percent ready.


Anna: What made it difficult to decide?


Oleg: Everything? Fear again.  Like, I did not know how they evaluate candidates. Also I didn’t know if my current manager would support me, because it would mean leaving. And I was afraid, if I apply and fail, it will look bad. Eehm, also I had a permanent contract recently, so I felt, okay, stability, but then taking a risk. I can't go back to Russia hahaha. 


Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed at that time?


Oleg: I needed someone to help me see the realistic plan. Like, what are the steps not just motivation. I needed plan and feedback whether i have that material no whether i am a  leadership material, what is missing. And also maybe emotional support, because I overthink a lot.


Anna: Okay. Thank you. Let us talk more generally now about career support.


3) Career support in general


Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?


Oleg: Usually people. I talk to friends, some are also in corporate. I also talk to my mentor sometimes. And sometimes I talk to my manager, but it depends, because manager is not always neutral. And I also use online resources, like articles sometimes forums but eehm, I filter a lot.


Anna: What tends to actually help?


Oleg: Practical stuff. Like, someone telling me, in this company, you need to do this to get promoted. Or, talk to this person. Or, write your internal profile like this. Also, mock interviews helped. Also, sometimes just talking and hearing myself. Like, when you speak, you realize what you want.


Anna: And what feels unhelpful or frustrating?


Oleg: инфоцыганство hahaha.


Anna: hahaha.


Oleg: A Like, follow your dreams be confident. I mean its neat but doesn’t help. 


Anna: Yes. Do you use any tools, like structured exercises, career tests, anything like that?


Oleg: I tried once some career test  like personality, but it felt very hmm поверхностно. It gave me results like analytical, introvert, whatever, and I was like, yes, I know. So no. I prefer conversations.


Anna: You mentioned a mentor. Can you tell me how that started?


Oleg: Yes. So, I came to Germany for Master. I studied Data Science did internships, but I was not sure how to enter a big company. A friend from Russian community introduced me to a guy, older, like 35 maybe, who worked in the company where I am now. He was in analytics, but more senior. We had a call, like an informational interview. And he was very open, explained the hiring process, what they look for. And then later, when there was an opening, he said, send me your CV, I can refer you. So that became mentoring, I guess.


Anna: How often did you meet?


Oleg: At the beginning, maybe once per month, then less. Sometimes every two or three months. It was not formal coaching, more like mentoring and career consultation.


Anna: And you experienced it overall as positive, you said.


Oleg: Yes, overall positive. Without him, I think I would not get this job. Or it would be much harder. So I value it a lot.


Anna: Okay. Lets go deeper into that experience, especially around trust.


4) Human coaching experience and trust 


Anna: Thinking about your experience with mentoring or career consultations, can you describe one specific moment that increased your trust in that mentor?


Oleg: Hmm. There was a moment early, when I asked him about salary expectations. I was afraid to ask because it is a sensitive topic. And he said, okay, listen, this is confidential. He literally said, whatever you say, stays between us. And then he opened the internal salary range, like not exact numbers, but he explained what is realistic for a junior analyst, what is too low, what is too high. And he also said, do not undersell yourself just because you are new in Germany. That made a hell lot of trust for him. Because he showed he understands the context and he is on my side.


Anna: What did he do that made it feel confidential, beyond just saying it?


Oleg: He did not share details with other people. Like, later I met someone from his team, and they did not know my situation. He would say, do not mention my name when you talk to HR, just say you heard it from internal sources. He protected himself and me. That felt professional.


Anna: So confidentiality and professionalism.


Oleg: Yes. And also competence. He knew the process. Like, he said, you will have HR screening, then technical interview, then business case, then final with hiring manager. He described what questions they ask. And it was super accurate.


Anna: Can you share an example where mentoring helped you concretely?


Oleg: Yes. So, first, he reviewed my CV. He changed it a lot. He said, German corporate CV is different. You need structure, bullet points, not too creative. He also said, quantify impact. So we added numbers from my internship. Like, reduced processing time, improved report accuracy, whatever. Then he helped with interview prep. We did a mock interview on Zoom. He asked me typical questions, and he stopped me when I was too long. He said, be concise, answer with this and that method. And then he referred me internally. He submitted my CV in the internal system. That gave me interview faster, because in big company, HR gets thousands.


Anna: That is a very nice mentoring i say.


Oleg: Yes.


Anna: When you think about trust in that relationship, what were the main drivers for you?


Oleg: Competence is number one. Like, do they know what they talk about. Then shared context. He worked in the same company, so it is not abstract. Then honesty about limits. Sometimes I asked, should I negotiate hard, and he said, I do not know your hiring manager, I cannot promise, but generally this works. So he was not pretending. And also feeling seen, like he remembered my background, that I moved from Russia, my Master, my anxiety. He would ask, how are you doing with German, are you okay in the team. That creates trust.


Anna: Did you ever experience something like trusted but not effective, with a human coach or mentor?


Oleg: Yes, actually. I had one session with a university career counselor during Master. She was very kind. Like, очень добрая, very warm. I trusted her in the sense she was not harmful. But it was not effective. She did not understand data roles in German market. She gave me generic advice like apply more, tailor your cover letter, go to job fairs. It did not move me forward. So I trusted her intentions, but it did not lead to progress.


Anna: Aha. You trusted her as a person, but the outcome was limited.


Oleg: Aha.


Anna: Did you ever have the opposite, where something was effective but you did not fully trust the person?


Oleg: Hmm. With humans, less. Maybe with a senior colleague once. He gave me a very good tip for stakeholder management. Like, always confirm requirements in writing, and document assumptions. It was effective. But I did not fully trust him personally, because he is political you know. He is nice, but he has certain you know


Anna: Yes i know aha


Oleg: So I took the advice, but I did not share my real doubts. So effective advice, but low trust on deeper level.


Anna: So you can act on something even without deep trust, if it is useful and low risk.


Oleg: Yes, if it is low risk and verifiable. But for personal questions, I need more trust.


Anna: What makes you distrust a human coach or mentor?


Oleg: If they are too confident without evidence. If they push their agenda. Or if they share stories about other clients in a way that feels not confidential. Also if they do not listen and just follow a script. 


Anna: In your current company, do you have any formal career development support?


Oleg: We have HR programs, like trainings, leadership academy, mentoring program. But it is bureaucratic. You apply, you wait. And sometimes it feels like checkbox. Also we have performance review once per year, and mid year check. There is a works council and rules, so some things are structured. But the real development is through manager support and projects.


Anna: How do you experience that system, as someone aiming for leadership?


Oleg: It is okay, but slow. Like German corporates are slow. Decisions take time. And for leadership, they like stability. They want you to prove yourself. Which is fine. But for me, I want clarity and steps.


Anna: Okay. Let us shift to AI now. You said you use AI a lot for work, but not for self reflection.


5) AI tools experience and trust 


Anna: What AI tools do you use at work, and what for?


Oleg: I use ChatGPT sometimes, and also internal company tools. We have an internal AI assistant in the Microsoft environment. It can summarize meetings, draft emails, help with Excel formulas. I use it mainly for productivity. Also for code. Like, I write SQL queries, and I ask it to optimize, or to generate a quick Python snippet for a data transformation. And sometimes I use it to write narrative for dashboards, like executive summary.


Anna: Can you give a concrete example of a moment where AI helped you a lot at work?


Oleg: Yes. There was a project about punctuality KPIs. We had to calculate delays, but the data source had weird logic. Some trains are cancelled, some are partial, some are replaced by buses. The stakeholder wanted a simple KPI for monthly report. I had to join multiple tables, handle edge cases. I wrote SQL, but it was messy. I asked AI to help me structure the query. I described the tables and logic without sensitive identifiers, just generic names. It suggested using CTEs, separate steps, and it reminded me about handling nulls and duplicates. It saved me maybe, I do not know, two hours. And it also explained why. That was very helpful.


Anna: And what made you comfortable using it in that case?


Oleg: Speed and I could verify. I run the query, check results, compare with baseline. So trust is not blind. It is like, assistant.


Anna: Have you had a moment where AI failed or felt risky?


Oleg: Oh yes. Many. One time it hallucinated. I asked for a Python snippet to do time series decomposition. It gave me code with a library that was not installed, and also wrong function name. I copied, it failed. Not dangerous, but annoying. Another time, more risky, I asked something about our internal policy, like, can we use certain customer data for analysis. It gave a confident answer, but it was wrong. And that can be serious. Because compliance, GDPR, Germany is strict. So I learned: do not trust AI for policies. You need official documents.


Anna: So you calibrate trust depending on the domain.


Oleg: Exactly. For code, okay. For compliance, no. Also privacy boundaries. I never paste sensitive data. I never paste customer information. We have rules. Sometimes people do it, but I do not. It feels risky. Also company has guidelines: do not upload confidential data to external AI.


Anna: What are your trust drivers for AI tools, compared to humans?


Oleg: For AI, trust is more like i can verify and stuff. Transparency helps, like if it shows sources, or explains steps and i can see if it makes things up or not i just need to be careful. 


Anna: And with human coaches? Is it the same?


Oleg: Yes, but with AI it is even more important. Because it can sound very confident but be wrong.


Anna: Do you ever use AI for career related tasks, like CV writing, job search, or decision support?


Oleg: I used it a little for CV wording. Like, I wrote bullet points and asked it to make them more concise. But I did not use it for big decisions. For job search, not really.


Anna: Why not?


Oleg: I don’t really know how i mean it feels artificial for self reflection. Like, I do not want to talk about my doubts with a chatbot. Also privacy. Even if they say it is safe, I do not know. And also, I prefer human feedback. When I process thoughts, I need a real person reacting, maybe challenging me. AI can simulate, but it does not feel the same.


Anna: What is missing exactly, for you?


Oleg: Emotional safety. Like, with a person, you have relationship, you see they care, they remember you. With AI, it is like talking to a wall that answers nicely. Also accountability. If a mentor says, do this, and next time asks, did you do it, that pushes. AI can remind, but it is not the same social pressure. And also, I worry it will give generic answers. Like career is messy. AI does not know the internal politics, my manager, my environment.


Anna: Do you think it is mainly about empathy, or about context knowledge?


Oleg: Both. Context and empathy. For work tasks, AI is great because the context is the prompt. For life, the context is huge.


Anna: Okay. Now I want to ask you to compare human and AI in specific career support tasks.


6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks


Anna: If you think about different career tasks, like clarifying options, making decisions, planning strategy, preparing for interviews, or writing a CV, where would you prefer a human, where would you prefer AI, and why?


Oleg: For CV formatting and wording, AI can help a lot. It is fast. Like, rewrite bullet points, adjust tone. But I still check, because sometimes it makes claims too strong, like 200 percent improvement, nonsense. So effective, but not fully trusted. I treat it as draft generator.


Anna: And for interview preparation?


Oleg: Mixed. 


Anna: And for clarifying options, like whether to pursue leadership or switch track?


Oleg: Human. Definitely. 


Anna: What about planning concrete steps towards leadership in your company?


Oleg: Human plus some AI support. Like, human mentor can tell me: talk to these stakeholders, join this project, volunteer to mentor juniors. AI can help me write an email to a senior manager, or prepare a 1 page plan. But the strategy and other stuff, human.


Anna: Can you think of a recent concrete career task where you used AI, and what happened?


Oleg: Yes. Recently I prepared for a performance review. We have annual review, and you need to write self evaluation. I used AI to structure it. I wrote my achievements, and asked it to make it more clear, and align to competencies. It gave me a nice structure. That was helpful. But I did not put sensitive numbers. I wrote general. And still, I did not fully trust it, because it can exaggerate. I edited.


Anna: So in that case, it was effective as a structuring tool.


Oleg: Yes, very effective for structure and wording.


Anna: And a human, did you involve anyone in that review preparation?


Oleg: I talked to my mentor a bit. He said, focus on impact and visibility. And he told me, ask your manager for a development plan. That was more strategic. So both contributed.


Anna: If you imagine a tool that is explicitly designed as a career coach chatbot, would that change anything?


Oleg: Maybe a little. If it is designed well, with boundaries, and if it is maybe integrated with German job market data. But still, for deep questions, I would want human.


Anna: What would make you consider using it for deeper questions?


Oleg: If I could be sure about privacy. If it is certified, maybe. And if it can show why it recommends something. Like evidence. And maybe if it is connected to a human coach, like hybrid. Then I can use AI for preparation and reflection, but human for decision.


Anna: That leads nicely to the trust and effectiveness link. But before that, I want to ask a short micro poll. These are 0 to 10 ratings. It is quick, and then I will ask why.




7) Trust–effectiveness link (micro poll embedded)


Anna: On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is complete trust, how would you rate your trust in human career coaches or mentors, in general?


Oleg: In general, hmm, maybe 7.


Anna: Why 7, and not higher or lower?


Oleg: Because I think humans can be very helpful, and I trust the right person. But not all coaches are competent. Some are generic. Also humans can have bias. So I do not give 10. But I trust more than AI for personal topics. So 7.


Anna: Same scale, trust in AI tools for career support specifically.


Oleg: For career support, maybe 4.


Anna: What drives that 4?


Oleg: Because AI can be useful, but I do not trust it with high stakes decisions. Also privacy and AI can be wrong. For technical tasks, my trust would be higher, like 7 or 8. But for career, 4.


Anna: Now perceived effectiveness. For your personal situation, how effective is human coaching or mentoring, 0 to 10?


Oleg: I would say 8.


Anna: Why 8?


Oleg: Because my mentor actually helped me get the job, and also helped with internal understanding. It led to concrete actions. It increased my confidence. So it is effective. Not 10 because sometimes even mentor cannot solve the system. Like, internal promotion is still uncertain. And sometimes advice is limited.


Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your personal situation, 0 to 10?


Oleg: For my situation, maybe 5.


Anna: Why 5?


Oleg: Because it can help with tasks like writing, structuring, generating options. That is effective. But it does not replace human for leadership decisions. So it is medium.


Anna: Thank you. Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness more directly. When you think about your experience, how does trust affect whether something feels effective?


Oleg: Trust is like, um, the entry point. If I do not trust, I do not use it deeply. Like with AI, even if it gives good advice, I might not act. Or I will double check so much that it loses value. With human, if I trust, I share more real information, like my fears, my doubts. Then the advice is better, more tailored. So trust enables depth, and depth enables effectiveness.


Anna: Can you give a specific example where trust increased effectiveness with your mentor?


Oleg: Yes. When I was preparing salary negotiation, I told him my real number, and my fear that they will reject me because I am foreign, and I needed visa stability. If I did not trust him, I would hide that. But because I shared it, he gave specific advice: focus on value, but also understand my risk tolerance. He said, okay, aim for X, but if they offer Y, it is still okay because you need entry. That was tailored. It was effective because it fit my real constraints.


Anna: And can you think of a case where you trusted but it was not effective, we touched one with the university counselor. Anything else?


Oleg: Another example: I had a friendly senior colleague, like a buddy. He listened, he was supportive, I trusted him emotionally. But when I asked about leadership track, he said, just wait, it will happen. And I was like, okay, but what should I do. He had no concrete steps. So trust, but low effectiveness.


Anna: And effective but not fully trusted, you mentioned AI for CV bullet points. Can you expand on that?


Oleg: Yes. AI can produce good bullet points quickly. That is effective. But I do not trust it fully because it can invent achievements. So I always verify. I treat it like speed, not authority. So it is effective, but trust is partial.


Anna: So effectiveness can exist without full trust if you can verify and the stakes are low.


Oleg: Yes 


Anna: Aha. If we break down trust drivers, for humans you mentioned competence, confidentiality, feeling seen, shared context, honesty about limits. For AI you mentioned reliability, verifiability, transparency, boundaries. Anything else?


Oleg: For AI, also consistency. Like, if it gives stable quality. And maybe integration. If it uses real data sources. For example, if it can cite German labor market, or internal job profiles. 


Anna: For humans, anything else?


Oleg: For humans, also values alignment. Like, if a coach values stability and I value growth, there is mismatch. And also, the ability to challenge me without being rude. Like, constructive.


Anna: When you think about effectiveness indicators, what tells you that a career support interaction was effective?


Oleg: For me, effectiveness is when I get my head cleared. Like, I decide something. Not just thinking. Also when I take action. Like, I schedule a meeting with my manager, I apply, I join a leadership training, I ask for a project. Also when I see outcomes: interview invitations, internal opportunities, better performance review, more confidence. Not only feeling good, but steps.


Anna: Do you think trust always leads to effectiveness?


Oleg: No. You can trust someone and still not get results, like we said. And you can get results without deep trust if it is technical. So trust helps, but it is not enough. Competence is key.


Anna: Does effectiveness build trust?


Oleg: Yes, definitely. If AI helps me reliably with code, I trust it more in that area. And if a mentor gives good advice, trust increases. But if one time it fails badly, trust drops quickly, especially for AI. For humans, maybe you forgive more if relationship is strong. But it depends.


Anna: That is interesting. Why do you forgive humans more?


Oleg: Because you assume good intentions. And you see they are limited. With AI, it is just output. If it is wrong, you feel, okay, it is unreliable.


Anna: Okay. Now I want to ask about your preferences and reaction to hybrid models.


8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction


Anna: Imagine a hybrid career coaching model where you have AI support for preparation, reflection prompts, structuring options, and follow up, and you also have access to human mentors or coaches for deeper conversations and key decisions. What is your first reaction?


Oleg: I mean sounds good i mean It sounds like the best combination. Because I do not want to spend human time on small tasks like rewriting text. That can be AI. But for leadership path, I want human.


Anna: What would make you adopt such a hybrid model?


Oleg: Quality of the human part. Like, who are the mentors. Are they real professionals. Also trust and privacy for the AI part .And prices matter. I am early career, I can’t pay a lot. .


Anna: In such a model, where would you want AI to lead, and where would you want a human to lead?


Oleg: I don’t really care the main is the result.


Anna: Okay. If the AI part asks you reflective questions, like what do you value, what do you fear, would you use it?


Oleg: Maybe a bit, but I would be cautious. It depends on how it is framed. If it is like journaling prompts, okay. But if it tries to interpret me, like you are this type, then no. I do not want психологический анализ from AI. I want a person.


Anna: What about if the AI part was designed to be very transparent, like it always says, I am not a therapist, I am a tool, and it shows you how it builds suggestions.


Oleg: Doesn’t matter how you frame it it is still same. 


Anna: How would you want the human coach to work with the AI output?


Oleg: It could be useful if I can bring a summary to the human. Like, AI helps me prepare: here are my goals, constraints, options. Then the human can go deeper. That saves time.


Anna: Would there be any red flags that would make you avoid a hybrid model?


Oleg: If it feels like the AI is replacing the human. Or if they push me to use AI only. Also if they collect too much data. Like, if they ask for my company name, salary, visa status, and store it. That would feel risky. Germany is sensitive about data I am now too hahaha. 


Anna: And what if the model matches you to a mentor based on your profile and goals?


Oleg: That is good, but I would want to understand the logic. Like, why this person. If it is a black box, I trust less. If it shows criteria, I trust more.


Anna: Do you think you would trust a mentor from your own company more, or an external one?


Oleg: Mixed. From my company, they have context, very useful. But also risk, because internal politics. 


Anna: If you had a human coach, what would you want them to help you with specifically, in the next three months?


Oleg: I want a plan steps to leadership. Like, identify skills gap. Identify projects to take. How to influence without authority. How to mentor juniors. And also how to talk to my manager about development. And maybe practice those conversations, because I get nervous about money talks.


Anna: If you had AI support, what would you want it to help with, in the next three months?


Oleg: Help me draft emails, structure my development plan, prepare for meetings, summarize feedback, and maybe simulate scenarios. Like, what if my manager says no. How to respond. But again, I would check.


Anna: Okay. We are close to the end. I want to ask a final closing block.


9) Closing


Anna: If you look back at everything we discussed, what feels like the biggest difference between trusting a human and trusting AI in this domain?


Oleg: So different types of trust. For me, human trust is like, do I feel safe, do I feel understood, is this person competent and confidential. AI trust is like tool trust does it work, can I verify. 
 
Anna: And the biggest difference in effectiveness?


Oleg: Human is effective for deep, messy problems and decisions. AI is effective for structure, speed, and low stakes tasks. 


Anna: Is there anything you wish I asked but did not?


Oleg: No.


Anna: Anything else you want to add?


Oleg: No. 


Anna: Thank you. I will stop the recording now.












Lena


Anna: Yes, perfectly. Thanks for joining today. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything is anonymous, you can skip any question, and you can stop at any time.


Lena: Yes, you can record.


Anna: Thank you. Just to confirm, I will use a pseudonym and remove identifying details like company names. Is there anything you prefer not to discuss today?


Lena: Um, I think it is okay. Maybe not super detailed about internal company stuff, like specific metrics, because I do not want to say something wrong. But overall, it is fine.


Anna: Alright.. We can keep company details out. 


Lena: Okay.


Anna: Great. And also, this is not a test. I am interested in your perspective so all answers are good.


Lena: Okay, sounds good.


Anna: Alright. Let us start.


2) Participant context and career situation


Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now, or recently faced?


Lena: Eehm, so I am finishing my Bachelor in Media Informatics. I am in Berlin now, but I am from Mainz originally. I moved here for the university and also for work, kind of both. And I work part time as a junior UX researcher, like Werkstudentin, at a mid size SaaS company. So I do research tasks, mostly around product discovery, usability tests, interviews. And the big question for me is like, what is my path after the Bachelor. Like, do I continue with UX research, do I go more into UX design, or do I go into product, like PM, product discovery, something like that. And also the question of where, like stay in Berlin, or maybe go back to Mainz area, or maybe somewhere else.  Or masters. I don’t know yet. But Berlin is kind of the obvious place for UX, I think.


Anna: When you say the big question is the path, what makes it difficult?


Lena: Um. Ehem. I think I have multiple things. One is, I like research a lot when I do it. Like the actual interviews, synthesis, finding patterns, it feels like my brain is good at that. But I also see that UX research roles are competitive and sometimes unclear. Like in Berlin, every startup says they want a UXR, but then they want someone who is also a designer and also a PM and also a data analyst. And I am like, okay, what are you actually hiring for. So that makes it stressful.


Anna: Aha, I was the same. 


Lena: Yes. And I don’t feel confident in selling myself. Like, I am okay in the work context, but in applications, I am really insecure. My German is great, I  mean am I German hahaha, my professional English is also great. But interviews, especially when you have to talk about impact, I freeze. And I see other people who are louder, and they can tell a story, and I am like, I did good work, but I cannot present it as a shiny story.


Anna: So it is not that you doubt your ability to do the work, but you doubt the packaging of it.


Lena: Yes, exactly. Like, I can do the research. But then, Bewerbungen, portfolio, case studies, interviews, I feel like I am weak. And I hate exaggerating, I hate the feeling of bragging.


Anna: What would you say was the most significant career decision in the last 6 to 12 months?


Lena: Hmm. I think the biggest one was whether to keep the job I have now, or switch to a different internship, like a bigger brand company. Because I had an offer from a startup, very early stage, and they said, you can do UX and product, like everything, and it sounded exciting. But it was also chaotic. And my current company is more structured. So I decided to stay. Also because I needed stability, like rent in Berlin is insane. And I have my thesis coming.


Anna: I see.  What made that decision difficult?


Lena: The fear of missing out, honestly. Like, the startup sounded like, wow, you can build everything, you can do huge impact. And in my current company, I am part time, and I do research, but I do not own the whole product. So I thought maybe I should go to the startup to have a stronger portfolio story. But also I was like, do I want to be in chaos while finishing my Bachelor. Probably not. And also the startup offered less money.


Anna: If you think about what kind of support you needed during that decision, what was it?


Lena: I needed someone to help me evaluate conflicting sides, like not only salary, but learning, mentorship, portfolio, mental health. And also someone who understands the Berlin market, like what matters for UX roles here. I talked to friends, but they are also students, so they guess. I wanted someone who knows how hiring works.


Anna: And now looking forward, what is the next decision that feels most pressing?


Lena: The thesis and the first full time step. Like, do I write my thesis with my company, or at university only. My company offered that I can do a thesis project related to their product, like research around onboarding or something. But then I worry about confidentiality and also scope creep. And if I do it at university only, I have more freedom but maybe less practical connection.


Anna: What would be the ideal outcome of the next, let us say, 3 to 4 months?


Lena: Ideally, I finish the thesis without panic hahaha.  And I have clarity, like, okay, I want to apply for UXR roles, and I have a portfolio that makes sense. Or if it is product, then I know what entry roles to target. Because right now, it is like a fog. I know what I like, but I do not know what to choose.


3) Career support in general


Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?


Lena: Eehm. Friends, sometimes. My boyfriend a little bit, but he is in software engineering, so he is like, just apply as fast and as much as you can.  My parents, but they are supportive emotionally, not really informed about UX. And then online resources, like articles, LinkedIn posts, sometimes YouTube, like career advice. And I used the university career service once. And I use AI tools for some things, like summarizing notes, rewriting CV bullets, especially in English.


Anna: What has actually helped you, and what has felt unhelpful or frustrating?


Lena: Helpful is talking to people who are actually in the field. Like I had one informal coffee chat with a UXR from another company, a friend of a friend, and she explained what she does, how she got hired, what her case study looked like. That was nice.  Unhelpful is like show your motivation, be confident. It is like, yes, but how.


Anna: When you say nice, what kind of nice?


Lena: Like, examples. Like, in your portfolio, structure your case study like this, problem, method, insight, impact, stakeholder. And also, what hiring managers actually look for. For example, she told me, for junior UXR, they do not expect you to have huge business impact, but they want to see your thinking, and that you can communicate. That was nice. 


Anna: How do you decide whether a source of support is worth listening to?


Lena: I think, if they understand my context. Like Germany, Berlin, junior roles, UX. And if they do not just project their own path. Also tone matters. If someone is like, you are behind, you should do more, it makes me shut down. If they are calm, and they ask questions, then I listen more. 


Anna: Listen more you mean trust?


Lena: Yes.


Anna: Aha. Thank you. 


Anna: Do you have any mentors inside the company?


Lena: Not officially. There is a senior researcher, she is nice, and she reviews my discussion guide sometimes. But she is very busy. And our PM sometimes gives feedback on my readouts, like, what is actionable. But it is not a formal mentorship.


Anna: And what about peers, like fellow students in your program?


Lena: Mixed. Some are supportive, but sometimes it becomes comparison. Like, someone says, I got invited to interviews at three startups, and I am like, okay, I am doing something wrong. So it is not always helpful.


4) Human coaching experience and trust


Anna: You mentioned you had one session with the university career service. Can you walk me through that session, like what triggered  you to book it, and what happened?


Lena: Yes. So, I booked it around, I think, May last year. Because I was starting to think about applications for internships and also like, what after Bachelor. And I felt stuck with my CV. In UX, it is weird because CV is one thing but portfolio is another. So I booked a slot, it was like 30 minutes, online, with a career advisor from the university.


Anna: What did you expect going into it?


Lena: I expected they would understand at least basics of UX roles, like difference between UX design and UX research and product. And I wanted feedback on my CV, and also maybe direction, like, what titles to search for. I wanted someone to look at my experience and say, okay, this is your narrative.


Anna: And what happened in the session?


Lena: It felt very template. Like, she opened my CV, she said, okay, you should use this standard template, like Europass style, or like their uni template. And she said, put your skills here, put your education here, and keep it one page. And I was like, okay, yes, but I am already doing that. And then I said, I am working as junior UX researcher, and she asked, so are you more like marketing research. And I was like, no, product research. And she was like, ah okay. Then she gave advice like, use action verbs, quantify achievements, mention tools. Which is fine, but it was like reading a checklist.


Anna: Was there anything that felt personalized at all?


Lena: Not really. She did not ask about what kind of role I want, or what kind of company, or what my strengths are. She did not ask for my portfolio at all. I was like, should I show it, and she said, we do not have time, but generally include a link. And it felt rushed. And no follow up, like, if you change it, send it again, nothing.


Anna: What emotions did you have during or after?


Lena: During, I was like, okay, maybe I was expecting too much but i felt very sad afterwards. Because I paid with my time, and I got basically nothing.  But, to be fair, one thing was helpful.


Anna: What was helpful?


Lena: She said, for Germany, sometimes companies like to see a short profile summary at the top, like a 3 line thing, and that I can frame it as, media informatics student with UX research experience in SaaS, skilled in qualitative interviews and synthesis, seeking junior roles in product research. And that actually helped me because I had no summary before. So that was one useful tip.


Anna:  Aha. Anything else? 


Lena: Like, it was useful, but the overall feeling was not trust. It was more like, okay, this is a service, they do generic stuff.


Anna: When you think about trust in a human career supporter, what are the main drivers for you?


Lena: Understanding. Like they actually listen and remember details. Also domain like they know UX, hiring, what a portfolio is, what a case study is, what stakeholders are. Confidentiality also structure, like a process. And non judgmental tone, like not making you feel stupid.


Anna: If you imagine an ideal real coach, what would you want them to do with you?


Lena: Hmm. I would want them to ask me questions first, like what motivates you, what kind of tasks give you energy, what you hate, what environment. Then help me map roles, like UXR, UX designer, product, and what skills overlap, what gaps. Then help me build a narrative for applications. Like, not lie, but show my value. And maybe do mock interviews, because that is my weakness.


Anna: What would make you distrust a human coach?


Lena: If they push their own agenda, like, you should do this because it worked for me. Or if they do not understand the field, but still act confident. Or if they are judgmental. Also if it feels like they are selling something, like upselling packages.


Anna: Have you ever trusted a friend a lot, but it was not effective?


Lena: Yes, actually. My best friend from Mainz, I trust her completely, like emotionally. She listens, she is kind. But she is studying psychology, not UX. So she says things like, follow your heart, you will figure it out. And it helps emotionally, it reduces anxiety, but it does not give me concrete action. So high trust, limited effectiveness for career decisions.


Anna:  Got it, thank you. For you, effectiveness is what exactly, like how do you know support is effective?


Lena: Effective means I know what to do after, like I can decide something. Or I have a concrete plan, like, apply to these roles, change these portfolio parts, talk to this person. Maybe confidence also, like I feel less small. Or measurable results like interview invites. But not only that, because sometimes you do everything and still no invites in this economy. But at least I feel my narrative is stronger and I can act.


Anna: So for you effectiveness includes clarity, confidence, concrete actions, and sometimes outcomes like interview invites?


Lena: Yes.


5) AI tools experience and trust


Anna: Thank you. Now I want to talk about AI tools. You mentioned you use AI for summarizing notes and rewriting CV bullets, but you avoid using it for deeper self reflection because it feels too impersonal. Can you tell me about your experience, what tools you use and for what?


Lena: I mostly use ChatGPT, like the normal one. And sometimes the built in AI in Notion for summarizing. But mainly ChatGPT. I use it after user interviews, but not with raw transcripts, more like my notes. I write messy notes during interviews, and then after, I paste them and say, can you structure this into themes, pain points, quotes, and possible insights. And it helps me to get a first draft. 


Anna: Can you give me a specific example of when it helped?


Lena: Yes. Two months ago, we did interviews about onboarding for a feature. We spoke with like six users, small sample, but still. And my notes were messy, because I was facilitating and note taking. After, I had like pages of bullet points. I put them in AI and asked it to cluster into themes and also highlight contradictions. And it gave me a structured summary. And I was like, yes, that is exactly it. It saved me time. Then I refined it myself.


Anna: So it helped with speed and structure?


Lena: Yes, and also with wording. Sometimes I have the insight in my head, but I cannot phrase it professionally or just don’t want to do it and it helps me write a sentence that sounds clear.


Anna: And in CV bullets, how do you use it?


Lena: I write a bullet like, conducted interviews and made report. And then I ask AI to rewrite it into impact focused bullet points, like, led 6 user interviews to identify onboarding friction, resulting in prioritized recommendations for product team. Stuff like that. HR love KPI. 


Anna: And now the other side. Can you describe a moment where AI failed, or felt risky, or made you uncomfortable?


Lena: Not really. I mean yes sometimes it outputs something that is obviously fake. Like, increased conversion by 30 percent, or improved user satisfaction significantly. And I am like, I did not measure that. So it pushes you to exaggerate. And if you do not pay attention, you might include lies. But it’s common knowledge and one must pay attention to it themselves. I mean always recheck or read what it got you. 


Anna: Aha. Anything else?


Lena: Privacy. At work, we have user data. We do interviews. I cannot paste raw transcripts because there are identifying details. So I am careful. I only paste my own abstracted notes. But still, sometimes I feel uneasy, like, am I allowed to do this. Even if it is anonymized, it is still internal. So I keep it low stakes. Also, AI sometimes makes assumptions about roles. Like, it will say, as a UX designer you should do this, and I am like, I am a researcher. It confuses me. So I do not trust it fully, but that's okay for me. 


Anna: So you have usefulness, but not full trust?


Lena: Yes 


Anna: I understand thank you. When you think about trust in AI tools, what drives trust for you?


Lena: Verifiability. Like, I can check. If it summarizes my notes, I can see if it matches. Consistency, like it always gives a structured output. Controllability, like I can prompt it, I can say shorter, more formal, include this. And low stakes. If it is a draft, it is fine. I do not trust it for decisions about my life, but I trust it for drafts.


Anna: What would reduce trust?


Lena: When it is too confident and wrong. Or when it gives advice that is generic but sounds authoritative. Or when it uses data it cannot know. Also, if it feels like it is making me into a generic person, like, here is your career path, and it is not me.


Anna: You said it feels too impersonal for deeper self reflection. Can you unpack that?


Lena: Um. It is like, if I talk about insecurity, I want a human reaction. Like, a person who actually knows me, who can say, you are not crazy, or who can challenge me. AI can respond kindly, but it feels like a script. And also I do not want to dump my emotional stuff into a tool. It feels weird. Like, is this real, is someone reading it, I do not know. So I avoid.


Anna: So that is a mix of emotional need and privacy uncertainty?


Lena: Yes.


6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks


Anna: Thank you. I want to compare human support and AI support through specific tasks. I will name a task, and you tell me what you would use, and why. First task is clarifying options, like mapping UX research versus product versus design. What would you use?


Lena: For mapping options, I would maybe start with AI because it is fast. It gives a broad overview. But then for actually choosing, I would want a human, like someone who knows me and can ask questions, because AI can list options but cannot feel what fits.


Anna: What about rewriting CV bullets or cover letters?


Lena: AI, definitely, for the first draft. But I would want a human to review for tone and truth, and to make sure it sounds like me, not like AI. But if I do not have a human, I still use AI.


Anna: Next task is preparing for interviews, like telling your story, answering questions.


Lena: Human would be better, I think. Because interview is social. You need feedback on how you speak, and confidence. AI can simulate questions, but it cannot really see you. But maybe AI could help generate question lists.


Anna: Thank you. Managing anxiety about applying, like procrastination, imposter feelings.


Lena: Human. Or like friend, therapist, someone. AI is not good for that, for me. It can give coping tips, but it is not the same.


Anna: Structuring your thesis decision, like thesis with company versus university.


Lena: Hmm. I would use both. AI for a pros and cons list, like a framework. Human for the emotional part and context, like what my supervisor expects, what the company might do, what the risk is.


Anna: You mentioned earlier that the university career service did not look at your portfolio due to time. For portfolio strategy, who would you trust more, AI or human?


Lena: Human, if they understand UX hiring. Because portfolio is nuanced. AI can suggest a structure, but a human can say, this is convincing, this is not. Also they know what looks junior, what looks senior.


Anna: Let us go into a specific work episode. Can you describe a moment at work where you felt strong and competent?


Lena: Yes. There was one meeting, like, I think in October. We had done usability testing on a new flow for setting up integrations. And the PM and the designer were convinced that the flow was fine, like minimal issues. But in testing, users got stuck at a step because of terminology. They thought integration means something else. I had clips, like short quotes, and I synthesized it into a clear insight: the mental model mismatch. In the readout, I presented it and I was like, this is not a small UI issue, it is conceptual. And the PM actually changed priority. He was like, okay, we need to adjust the copy and add guidance. And later he told me, good catch, we would have shipped confusion.


Anna: What did you do in that moment that made it successful?


Lena: I mean I was prepared. I had evidence, like quotes, patterns, not just friction. I also explained the why, like mental model, not just, users are confused. I could answer questions like, how many users, what scenarios, is it edge case. And I felt like, okay, I can influence.


Anna: And a moment where you felt insecure, especially around selling yourself?


Lena: Job applications, always. But also even inside the company, sometimes. Like, when we have a meeting with leadership, and they ask, what is the impact of research, and I am like, I do not have numbers. And I see senior people speak confidently. And I feel small. And then I think, in interviews, it will be worse. Because you have to say, I am great, hire me. And I just cannot.


Anna: What is the inner dialogue in those moments?


Lena: It is like, you are just a student, you are not real. Like, you only did small projects. Others have real impact. And then I compare myself. Especially in Berlin, there are many people with shiny portfolios.


Anna: When you say shiny portfolios, what do you mean?


Lena: Like, beautiful case study websites, perfect storytelling, big brand logos. And they write like, drove strategic decisions, delivered measurable outcomes. And I am like, maybe they also exaggerate, but it still affects me.


Anna: Does AI play any role in that insecurity, like making it worse or better?


Lena: Better in the sense that it helps me write. Like, when I feel blocked, it gives me words. Worse in the sense that it can produce those shiny lines, and then I feel like, do I have to sound like that to be hired. It pushes the standard higher.
7) Trust–effectiveness link


Anna: Thank you.  Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human support, how does trust affect whether it is effective?


Lena: Trust is like a gate. If I do not trust the person, I will not share the real problem. Like, I will keep it superficial. Then the advice is superficial. In the career service session, I did not trust she understood UX, so I did not talk about deeper confusion. I just asked about CV. So it limited what could be effective.


Anna: And when you do trust, what changes?


Lena: I can say, I am scared, I feel like an imposter, I do not know what to choose. And then a person can help with that. But if I do not trust, I stay in safe topics.


Anna: How about AI, does trust work the same way?


Lena: Similar but different. With AI, if I do not trust it, I still might use it for drafts, because it is easy. Like, I can use it pragmatically. So trust is not necessary for some usefulness. But for high stakes, like, should I choose product or research, trust matters because otherwise I will not act on it.


Anna: Can you give an example where AI was useful but you did not fully trust it?


Lena: As I said before CV bullets. It gives me a good wording, but I do not trust that the bullet is truthful or appropriate. So I check and edit. It is useful, but not trusted as final.


Anna: And can you give an example where a human was trusted but not effective?


Lena: My friend, like I said. She is very trustworthy as a person. But the advice is like, you will be fine, choose what feels right. It helps emotionally, but it does not create action. So I trust her, but the career problem remains.


Anna: If we zoom out, what makes you say something is effective, independent of trust?


Lena: I think effectiveness is outcome, like does it move me forward. But trust influences whether I can engage deeply enough to get that outcome. In low trust, you can still get a small tip, like the summary paragraph in the CV. That was effective in a small way. But the bigger questions need trust.


Anna: And for AI, could something be effective even if trust is low?


Lena: Yes like summarizing notes. Even if I do not trust it emotionally, it can still do the structure. But I would not let it decide.


8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction


Anna: I want to ask you now some quick ratings, like a micro poll. It is 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all, 10 is full trust. First, trust in human career coaches, in general, like your expectation, including your experience with the university career service. What number would you give?


Lena: Hmm. Maybe a 6.


Anna: Why a 6?


Lena: Because I think humans can be very good if they understand the domain and if they care. I believe that. But my only official experience was generic, and I know there are also bad coaches. So it is not like automatic trust. It depends. So 6 is like, open but cautious.


Anna: And trust in AI tools for career related tasks, 0 to 10?


Lena: For career tasks, maybe 7 for small tasks, but overall, I would say 5.


Anna: Can I ask you to please stick with one number for overall, and then explain.


Lena: Okay, overall 5.


Anna: Why 5?


Lena: Because I trust it to help with drafts, structure, brainstorming. But I do not trust it with personal context and decision making. Also privacy concerns. So it is like half.


Anna: Next, perceived effectiveness of human coaching for your situation, 0 to 10.


Lena: Effectiveness, I would say 6 again.


Anna: Why 6?


Lena: Because I can imagine it being very effective if it is the right coach. But the career service was not very effective. It gave one good tip, but not clarity. So I rate it moderate.


Anna: Perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10.


Lena: For my situation, maybe 6.


Anna: Aha so you have AI effectiveness similar to human.


Lena: Yes, because for practical stuff, AI helps a lot, like saving time. But for the big decision, it does not help. So overall it is moderate.


Anna: If we separate trust and effectiveness, can you see cases where trust is higher than effectiveness, or effectiveness higher than trust?


Lena: Yes. With my friend, trust higher than effectiveness. With AI, effectiveness sometimes higher than trust, like it can produce a good structure even if I do not trust it fully.


Anna: Great. Now I want to introduce a concept of a hybrid model. Imagine a service where you have an AI that helps you prepare, like clarifying your situation, structuring your thoughts, drafting CV bullets, and collecting your experiences into a narrative. Then you have access to a human coach or mentor for key moments, like decision making, mock interviews, and emotional support. How does that sound to you?


Lena: That sounds ideal, honestly. Because I do not want to pay a human for everything. Like, if I have to pay 100 euros per hour for someone to rewrite my bullet points, it feels wasteful. But I would pay for someone to help me with strategy and confidence.


Anna: What would you want the AI part to do, specifically?


Lena: I would want it to help me prepare. Like, ask me questions, extract my experiences, help me build a portfolio outline, help me write drafts. Also maybe track applications, like reminders, but that is more tool. And also give me prompts for reflection that are not too therapy. Like, what tasks energize you, what environment, but in a structured way. Maybe I would do that if it feels like a guided worksheet, not like emotional chat.


Anna: And what would you want the human part to do?


Lena: Validate, challenge, and personalize. Like, look at my portfolio and say, this is strong, this is weak, and why. Do mock interviews and give feedback on how I present. And also help me decide between paths. And if I cry, they do not freak out hahaha. 


Anna: What would make you skeptical about the hybrid model?


Lena: Data privacy and how the AI uses my information. Like, who owns it, where it goes. Also, if the AI gives generic outputs, it would annoy me. And also the quality of the human. Like, if it is just random mentors, not trained, then it could be risky.


Anna: If you had to choose, would you prefer one consistent human person, or rotating mentors?


Lena: Consistent. Because trust needs continuity. If I have to explain my story again, it is exhausting.


Anna: And would you be open to AI being present during a human session, like summarizing, or suggesting questions?


Lena: Maybe, if it is transparent. Like, if the AI is only taking notes and I can see the notes, and it is not like spying. It could be helpful. Because then I can focus on talking, and later I have a summary.


Anna: What kind of boundaries would you want clearly stated?


Lena: Like, AI is not making decisions for you. It is not therapy. It does not store sensitive data unless you choose. It does not use your data to train something without consent. And the human is bound by confidentiality. Like, clear.


Anna: If you think about your reluctance to do deep self reflection with AI, could a hybrid model change that?


Lena: Maybe. Because if I know a human will see it later, then it feels less like talking into the void. Like, the AI could collect my thoughts, and then the human can discuss. That feels less impersonal. But I still would not want to write very emotional stuff to AI.


Anna: Thank you. 


9) Closing


Anna: We are almost at the end. If you think about someone like you, early career in Berlin, UX leaning, what is one thing you wish career support services understood better?


Lena: That UX is not just a normal job application process. It is portfolio, storytelling, and ambiguity. And also that juniors need help translating real work into a narrative, without exaggerating. And that confidence issues are real, like introverts exist hello.


Anna: If you could design your perfect support journey in one sentence, what would it be?


Lena: A structured process that helps me turn my experience into a clear story, with practical steps, and a human who understands UX and makes me feel safe.


Anna: Anything else you want to add that we did not cover?


Lena: No. 


Anna: Thank you, Lena. This was very helpful. 


Lena: Okay. Thank you. It was actually nice to talk about it.


Anna: It was a pleasure interviewing you. Have a good evening.


Lena: You too. Bye.






Mehmet
1)  Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Mehmet. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything is anonymous, you can skip any question, and you can stop anytime.
Mehmet: Yes, you can record. It is okay.
Anna: Great. And just to confirm, you are comfortable with the topic, it is about your experiences with career support, human coaching, and AI tools.
Mehmet: Yes, totally.
Anna: Is there anything you prefer not to discuss today?
Mehmet: Hmm. Not really. Maybe not the exact company name, because, you know, Germany and Munich is small world. But otherwise okay.
Anna: Perfect. We will keep it anonymous. If any detail feels too specific, just tell me and we can generalize it. And one more thing, I may ask follow-up questions to understand your experience better, but there are no right answers.
Mehmet: Yes, okay.
Anna: Great. Let us start.


2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now, or recently faced?
Mehmet: Okay. So, eehm, I am 26. I am from Turkey. I came to Germany, Munich, six years ago. I did my Master’s in Mechanical Engineering here in Munich. After graduation I started working as a project engineer. I am in automotive supply chain, like Tier 1 supplier side, but we are very close to OEM, so we deliver modules and we are always under OEM pressure, you know.
Anna: Mm-hm.
Mehmet: And my question now is, I feel stuck. Like I am doing execution, execution, execution. Deadlines, quality topics, meeting after meeting. And I want to move into, I would say, product management or operations strategy. Something where I am not only firefighting, but also shaping how we do things. But I struggle with language, like corporate German, and also framing. Because in engineering, you do a lot, but you cannot always explain it as impact.
Anna: When you say stuck, what does that look like day to day?
Mehmet: Day to day is, eehm, I have my project plan, I track open points, I coordinate with production, quality, logistics. There is always some issue. Like a supplier is late, or a component has a deviation, or OEM changes requirement, and we need to react. I am basically the person that pushes and aligns. In German they like to say Abstimmung, alignment. So I am like the ash. 
Anna: Okay. And what feels missing?
Mehmet: The missing is, I do not own the why. I own the how. Like, okay we need to deliver this variant, we need to meet SOP date, we need to reduce scrap, okay. But I am not in the discussion of, should we change the process, should we change supplier strategy, should we change product roadmap for the module. That is more like product or operations strategy. And I see those people, they speak differently. They speak with, you know, business words, and in meetings they are confident.
Anna: What do product management and operations strategy mean to you, concretely?
Mehmet: Product management for me means, you decide what features, what variants, you prioritize, you talk with customer, you build business case. It is not only technical requirement list. And operations strategy is more like, how do we run the factory or supply chain in a smarter way. Like standardization, make or buy, supplier development, risk management, maybe digitalization. Not just reacting, but planning.
Anna: Have you had a significant career decision in the last six to twelve months?
Mehmet: Yes. Actually the biggest decision was, do I stay in automotive at all. Because automotive in Germany is like, eehm, stress, and also now all this transformation, e-mobility, cost pressure, layoffs, hiring freezes. In my company it is stable, but you always hear rumors.
Anna: Mm.
Mehmet: So I had an offer from a smaller company, not automotive, like industrial machinery. But it was more technical. And my manager also offered me to take a new project, more critical, more visibility. I had to decide, do I take this and maybe get promoted in the same path, or do I pivot.
Anna: And what did you decide?
Mehmet: I stayed. I took the project. Because I thought, okay, if I want to move into product or ops, I need credibility and visibility. But also, honestly, visa situation. I am on Blue Card now. I got it after I started full-time. So stability matters. Munich rent is crazy.
Anna: So stability and building credibility. What made it difficult?
Mehmet: Difficult is, I do not trust that doing more execution will lead to strategy roles. Sometimes it feels like you become good at firefighting and they keep you there. And also language. Like, my English is fine. German is, I would say B1-B2, but corporate German is another world. When people speak in meetings, it is like, eehm, they speak politely but they are pushing. I struggle to do that.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed around that decision and around the current situation?
Mehmet: I needed someone to tell me, okay, what is the path, how to translate your experience. How to speak. How to position myself internally. Also maybe which certificates or steps make sense. And also, eehm, confidence. Because sometimes I feel like outsider. Turkish, accent, not perfect German, and in Munich corporate culture it is very, I do not know, polished.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Mehmet: I talk with my friends, mostly other internationals. Also my girlfriend, she is German, she helps with language and also she understands the culture. I sometimes talk to my manager, but I am careful, because you do not want to look like you are leaving.
Anna: Right.
Mehmet: I use online resources, LinkedIn, YouTube, sometimes those German career channels. And I use AI a lot, like daily. For emails, meeting prep, translation. And also for career conversations, like how to craft CV, how to answer interview questions. And I did human coaching, like a paid package.
Anna: What has actually helped so far, and what has felt unhelpful?
Mehmet: Helpful is AI for language, 100 percent. It makes me faster and more confident. Also, informational interviews helped, like I reached out to one person in my company who moved from project engineering to operations excellence. We had coffee. That was helpful because he gave realistic steps.
Anna: And unhelpful?
Mehmet: Unhelpful is generic advice. Like, network more, tailor your CV, show leadership. Okay, but how, you know. And sometimes human coach gave me that. Also, some German content online is too general, and it assumes you are German native, so they do not address the language barrier.
Anna: When you say you reached out internally, how did you do it?
Mehmet: Eehm, I wrote on Teams. Very polite. I used AI to write it in German. Like, Hallo Herr so-and-so, ich interessiere mich fuer Ihren Werdegang, koennten wir uns 20 Minuten austauschen. Something like that.
Anna: And how did that go?
Mehmet: It went good. He was friendly. We met in the cafeteria. He told me, you need to show impact, not tasks. And you need to volunteer for cross-functional initiatives. And he said German is important for leadership roles, but not perfect, just confident.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust
Anna: You mentioned you did a paid career coaching package. Can you tell me about it? What did the package include?
Mehmet: Yes. So I found it on Instagram, actually. The coach was German, she had like, eehm, HR background and coaching certificate. The package was six sessions, one hour each, over two months. And there was homework. She gave templates, like values exercise, strengths, and a CV template, and a story template, like STAR method but also German version. And she had accountability, like you need to send your homework before next session.
Anna: What did you like about it?
Mehmet: Structure. Because I am engineer, I like structure. It was like, session one clarify goals, session two strengths and achievements, session three target roles, session four CV and LinkedIn, session five interview prep, session six action plan. So I knew what is coming. Also the homework forced me to think, not only talk.
Anna: And what did not work?
Mehmet: The coach did not understand engineering reality. Like she would say, just highlight leadership, like leading projects. And I said, in my role, leadership is not official, it is informal, and also we have strict processes. She suggested things like, you should propose a new product idea to the OEM. And I am like, eehm, I cannot just propose product idea. We are supplier. There are contracts. There are change requests, it is very formal. Also she mapped roles in a too simple way. Like, she said, project engineer can go to product manager easily. But in automotive, product management is sometimes technical product management, sometimes it is commercial. And they want German, customer communication.
Anna: Can you recall a specific moment that was memorable, where you felt that mismatch?
Mehmet: Yes. One session she asked me to write my biggest achievement. I wrote about solving a quality escalation. We had a part issue from a sub-supplier, and OEM found it in incoming inspection, and they threatened to stop line, like line stop is huge. I coordinated a containment action, 24 hours, we did sorting, we negotiated with supplier, we updated OEM with daily status, and we avoided line stop. It was stressful but we succeeded.
Anna: That is quite an example.
Mehmet: Yes. And she said, okay, nice, but you should not talk about firefighting, you should talk about strategy. And I said, but that is the reality, this is what I did. And she tried to rewrite it like, I led strategic quality initiative. And I was like, no, it was not strategic, it was urgent. But it still shows skills. She did not see that.
Anna: So she wanted to force it into a strategy narrative that did not feel true.
Mehmet: Exactly. And then I started to feel, she is nice, and I trust she wants to help, but she does not understand my world. So I cannot fully use her advice.
Anna: When you say trust, what makes you trust a human coach, in general?
Mehmet: For me, trust is competence first. Like, they should understand engineering and corporate environment. Not necessarily mechanical engineering, but at least how projects work, constraints, stakeholders, timelines. Second is structure, like process. Third is accountability, like they follow up. And empathy without fluff. Like I do not want too much motivational talk. I want practical.
Anna: Mm-hm. Anything else?
Mehmet: Concrete examples. If coach says, I helped someone move from project engineer to product, and they can explain steps, then I trust more.
Anna: Did you feel any of that with your coach?
Mehmet: Structure yes. Accountability yes. Empathy yes, she was kind. But competence in engineering reality, not enough. So I would say, I trusted her as a person, but not fully trusted her advice.
Anna Thank you. So trusted, but not effective?
Mehmet: Yes, exactly. I liked her, I felt safe, I could talk, but the output was not so effective for my situation.
Anna: When you say safe, what created that feeling?
Mehmet: She was not judging, she listened, she kept confidentiality, she did not share anything. And she was professional, like on time, prepared. That creates trust.
Anna: Did you ever hold back anything because of trust issues?
Mehmet: Not really. I am not very private. I can tell. 
Anna: We will come back to privacy later.
Mehmet: Okay.
5) AI tools: experience and trust
Anna: Let us talk about AI tools. You said you use AI daily. What tools do you use, and for what?
Mehmet: I use ChatGPT and also sometimes DeepL for translation. But ChatGPT is more flexible. I use it for writing emails in German, like to be polite but also clear. I use it to prepare for meetings, like I put agenda and notes and ask, what questions will they ask, what risks. I use it to summarize long Teams chat or notes. And for career, I use it for CV bullet points, cover letter, interview questions, and also to practice German corporate phrases. Like, how to say I disagree politely. Claude code, Cursor, n8n and all other stuff.
Anna: Can you give me an example where AI clearly helped at work?
Mehmet: Yes. Last month we had a supplier delay, and we needed to inform OEM program manager. In German you cannot say, you are wrong, or we are late, like direct. You say, eehm, there is a deviation, and we are working on mitigation, and we propose next steps. I wrote a draft and it sounded too blunt. I asked AI, rewrite in German corporate tone, like with those phrases, wir moechten Sie informieren, wir bitten um Verstaendnis, wir sind im engen Austausch. And it created a very good email. My boss even said, good wording.
Anna: What was the risk in that situation?
Mehmet: The risk is, if the email is too direct, they escalate. If too soft, they think you are hiding. So you need balance. AI helped with that.
Anna: And can you share an example where AI failed or caused a risk?
Mehmet: Yes. I once asked AI to draft an email to HR about internal mobility, like I want to explore opportunities in product management. And AI wrote something too strong, like I am unhappy in my current role and I want to change quickly. And that is dangerous. Because in Germany HR is, eehm, they document things. So I did not send. But I realized, okay, AI does not know internal politics. Also sometimes it hallucinates, like it adds policies that do not exist. It wrote something like, according to company guideline 4.3, you can apply after 12 months. I was like, what guideline, hahahah. 
Anna: How did you catch that?
Mehmet: Because I know there is no guideline 4.3. And also it sounded too confident. So I checked our intranet. And it was different.
Anna: How do you generally verify AI output?
Mehmet: Depends. For translation and tone, I do quick check. I read it and if it sounds okay, I use it. For technical content, I verify more. Like if it summarizes technical discussion, I check key numbers, tolerances, deadlines. For HR or sensitive topics, I verify a lot, and I ask my girlfriend or colleague.
Anna: So verification level depends on stakes.
Mehmet: Exactly.
Anna: What makes you trust AI in these tasks?
Mehmet: Speed, first. It is immediate. Second, repeatability. I can ask again, change tone, shorter, more formal. Third, no judgment. I can ask stupid questions, like what does this German phrase mean, and it will answer. Fourth, convenience, 24/7. Sometimes at 23:00 I prepare something for morning meeting.
Anna: And what reduces your trust?
Mehmet: When it gives wrong facts, or when tone is off. Like too formal, or too American, you know. Or it creates something that looks real but is not. That is dangerous.
Anna: You also mentioned privacy. You said you know privacy is weak but you do not care much. Can you say that in your own words?
Mehmet: Yes. Eehm, honestly, I think privacy is kind of an illusion now. Like, everyone already has your data. Google, WhatsApp, company systems. People share everything on Instagram. So I feel like, what am I protecting? I am not a celebrity. I am not doing illegal things. So I do not care much. I assume everyone already knows everything. So I have nothing to lose.
Anna: Does that affect whether you trust AI?
Mehmet: Yes, because I do not worry. I just use it. I do not overthink. If I was very privacy person, maybe I would not paste emails or details. But I do.
Anna: Do you ever paste confidential company information?
Mehmet: Hmm. I try not to paste, like, very confidential numbers. But I paste context. Like, schedule, topics, general. But yes, I share a lot.
Anna: And you feel okay with that.
Mehmet: Yes. In my mind, if company wants to be safe, they should provide their own tool. If they do not, then, eehm, people will use what exists.
Anna: Interesting. If I push a bit, do you see any scenario where privacy would matter for you?
Mehmet: Maybe if it is about health, or like family. But career topics, I do not mind. And emails, I mean, they are already in systems.
Anna: So for you, privacy is not a strong component of trust.
Mehmet: Exactly. Trust for AI is more about, will it help me and not create problems.
Anna: Okay.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks
Anna: I want to compare human and AI through specific tasks. Let us take one task like translating your execution experience into a product management narrative. If you had to do that tomorrow, what would you use, human coach or AI, and why?
Mehmet: Eehm. I would start with AI. Because AI can help me write bullet points and give me structure. Like, it can take my messy notes and make it into achievements. And also it helps with German phrasing. But I would want a human, ideally someone who understands engineering, to validate if the story is credible and if it matches PM expectations.
Anna: So AI for draft, human for reality check.
Mehmet: Yes. Because AI sometimes makes it too polished and not realistic.
Anna: Another task.Preparing for an internal meeting where you need to influence stakeholders, like quality manager, production, maybe purchasing. What do you use?
Mehmet: AI helps to prepare agenda and questions. Like, what arguments, what risks, what data. But human helps with politics. Like, who is sensitive, who needs to feel respected, what to say in the room. AI cannot know that.
Anna: And another task. Deciding whether to invest heavily in German language or instead focus on technical certifications for a pivot. How would you handle that?
Mehmet: That is more human. Because it is personal and also depends on my life. But I still use AI to brainstorm pros and cons. But decision is, eehm, I need someone to challenge me, to ask why. AI can ask, but it is not the same.
Anna: Why not the same?
Mehmet: Because with human, you feel accountable. Like if I tell someone, I will do German course, then next session they ask, did you do it. AI does not care.
Anna: What about CV rewriting, cover letters?
Mehmet: AI is very good, very effective. Human coach also can help, but AI is faster and cheaper. And I can iterate many times.
Anna: Interview practice?
Mehmet: Mixed. AI can simulate questions, but human can read my vibe, my confidence, and also tell me if my story makes sense. And especially in Germany, cultural style matters. Like not overselling, but also not under-selling. That is hard.
7) Trust–effectiveness link
Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness. In your experience, how does trust affect whether a coaching method is effective?
Mehmet: For human, trust is necessary. If I do not trust the coach, I will not tell the real issues. Like, maybe I am insecure, or maybe I have conflict with manager, or maybe I feel discrimination. If I do not trust, I will say only surface. Then coaching is not effective. So trust is like, access to truth.
Anna: And for AI?
Mehmet: For AI, trust is different. Because I can still use it even if I do not fully trust. Like, I can ask it to write an email. It can be effective, even if I do not trust it fully, because I will check it. So effectiveness can happen with partial trust.
Anna: That is an important distinction. Can you give an example of effective but not trusted?
Mehmet: Yes. Sometimes AI writes a perfect email, like very diplomatic. It is effective because stakeholder reacts well. But I do not trust that it is correct, so I read it carefully. I think, is this too much, is this wrong. So I use it but I have doubt.
Anna: And trusted but not effective, you already mentioned with the coach.
Mehmet: Exactly. I trusted her as person, but advice did not fit engineering reality. So not effective.
Anna: What counts as effectiveness for you, in this career support context?
Mehmet: Effectiveness is, I get clearer narrative about my work. Like, I can explain myself in interviews or internally. Second, I get interview invites or internal conversations. Third, I can take steps for internal mobility, like apply, talk to people, join initiative. Fourth, in meetings I feel more confident and I can influence better. Like, not just follow.
Anna: So effectiveness is not only feelings, but concrete outcomes.
Mehmet: Yes. Feelings are part, but I want outcomes.
Anna: Do you think trust always leads to effectiveness?
Mehmet: No. You can trust someone and still they cannot help. Like my coach. Or you can trust a human who is kind but not competent. And then you waste time. So trust is not enough. Competence and fit is needed.
Anna: And can effectiveness build trust over time?
Mehmet: Yes. If AI helps me many times, I trust more. Even if I know it can be wrong, I rely more. For human also, if coach gives me one good insight, I trust more.
Anna: You mentioned earlier you are not very concerned about privacy. Some people connect privacy with trust, especially for AI. In your case, do you see any downside in not caring?
Mehmet: Hmm. Maybe I am naive. But, eehm, I think if something bad happens, like data leak, then I will care. But until then, I do not. It is pragmatic.
Anna: Does that pragmatism affect your willingness to use AI for deeper career reflection?
Mehmet: Yes. I use it for deeper reflection too. Like, I ask, what are my strengths, what are possible career paths. I tell it my situation. I do not feel blocked.
Anna: Okay.
Micro-poll ratings 
Anna: I want to include a quick micro-poll, just to structure the comparison. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is full trust, how much do you currently trust human career coaches?
Mehmet: Hmm. I would say 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Mehmet: Because I think humans can be helpful, and they can understand emotions and context. But many coaches are generic. And I do not know how to find a good one. So I cannot give 8 or 9.
Anna: Same scale, trust in AI tools for career-related support?
Mehmet: I would say 7.5.
Anna: Why higher?
Mehmet: Because I use it daily, and it helps. I trust it for language and structure. But I do not trust it for facts always, so not 9.
Anna: Now perceived effectiveness for your situation. Effectiveness of human coaching you experienced, 0 to 10.
Mehmet: For my situation, maybe 5.
Anna: Why 5?
Mehmet: It gave me structure and some clarity, but it did not move me closer to product roles. It did not change outcomes yet.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10.
Mehmet: That is higher, maybe 8.
Anna: Why 8?
Mehmet: Because it improves my daily work and communication, and it helps me prepare career documents fast. It is very practical.
Anna: Great, thank you. 
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction
Anna: If you imagine an ideal setup, what would you prefer: only human coaching, only AI support, or a hybrid model?
Mehmet: Hybrid. Definitely.
Anna: What does hybrid mean for you?
Mehmet: AI for preparation, drafts, language. Human for big decisions, for accountability, and for industry reality check. And also for networking maybe. Like a human can connect you, or tell you where to look.
Anna: If I describe a model where you have an AI assistant that helps you clarify goals, prepare materials, and then you can book sessions with experienced insiders in your target field, how do you react?
Mehmet: That sounds good. Because my problem is, I do not know where to find a good coach. If it is insider, like someone who did product in automotive or operations, then I would trust more. And AI can help me not waste human time with basic things.
Anna: What would you be cautious about in such a model?
Mehmet: Quality control. Like, who are these insiders, are they really good. And also cost. In Munich everything is expensive. And maybe, eehm, matching. Like, if you match me with someone from marketing, it will not help.
Anna: So domain fit is key.
Mehmet: Yes. And also language. If insider speaks English, I can do it. But if they only speak German, it is hard. But maybe that is also training.
Anna: Would you want the insider to be very empathetic, or more direct and practical?
Mehmet: Practical and direct. Empathy is good, but not too much. Like, do not tell me, you are amazing, believe in yourself. Tell me, do this, do that, and why.
Anna: If you could design the first session with such an insider, what would you want to achieve by the end?
Mehmet: I want a realistic path. Like, in my company or in Munich market, what are the roles, what skills, what steps. And I want to know, should I focus on German, on certifications, on internal projects. And I want feedback on my story, like how to position my quality escalation example as leadership.
Anna: And what would AI do before that session?
Mehmet: AI would help me write my achievements, translate, and prepare questions. Also summarize my situation so insider can read and not spend time on basics.
Anna: You mentioned earlier you are not overly excited about human coaches, but still want to try a good one. Can you say more about that?
Mehmet: Yes. I think human coaches are fine, but many are like, eehm, same. They sell packages, they have nice websites, but I do not know if they can help an engineer. I am not against it. I just do not feel, wow, coaching will change my life. But if I find a coach who is credible, then I am interested.
Anna: How would you try to find that credible person?
Mehmet: That is the problem. I do not know. Maybe through recommendation. Or LinkedIn. Or platforms. But it is hard to evaluate before paying.
Anna: So trust formation is hard upfront.
Mehmet: Yes. You need signals. Like background, client stories, but those can be marketing.
Anna: In your experience, did AI play any role in helping you evaluate coaches?
Mehmet: Yes, I asked AI, what questions should I ask a coach before buying. It suggested to ask about experience, methodology, success examples. That was useful. But I did not do it strongly, because I am polite. 
9) Closing

Anna: We are close to the end. Is there anything we did not cover that feels important about your experience with human coaching and AI for career support?
Mehmet: Maybe one thing. AI helps me with German corporate language, but it also makes me dependent. Like, sometimes I think, can I write without it. And also, if everyone uses it, then the standard becomes higher. So you need it to keep up.
Anna: That is interesting. Like an arms race.
Mehmet: Yes, exactly. And for human coaching, I think it can be good, but it must be tailored to reality. For engineering, we need someone who understands constraints.
Anna: If you could give one advice to a human coach working with someone like you, what would it be?
Mehmet: Learn the engineering context. Ask about real projects and constraints. Do not force strategy words that are not true. Help translate reality into impact, not invent.
Anna: And one advice to an AI tool designer for career support?
Mehmet: Make it understand German corporate culture better. Like tone, indirect phrasing, and also industry context. And maybe include warnings when content is risky, like HR emails. Because sometimes AI is too confident.
Anna: Thank you. Final question, how are you feeling about your next step right now, like today?
Mehmet: Today I feel, eehm, more hopeful than six months ago. Because I see options. I started German course again, and I did two informational coffees. Small steps. But still, I feel stuck sometimes.
Anna: Thank you for being open, Mehmet. If you have any questions for me about the study, you can ask now.
Mehmet: No, all good. It was interesting to reflect.
Anna: Great. Then we stop here. Thank you again.






Sofia
1) Opening and consent
Anna: Hi Sofia, thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything will be anonymised, and you can skip any question.
Sofia: Hi Anna. Yes, you can record. That is okay.
Anna: Great. Just to double check, if anything feels uncomfortable, you can pause me or say you want to skip. Sound okay?
Sofia: Yes. Sounds good. I am a bit nervous but, um, okay hahaha. 
Anna: Totally normal. We can take it slow. Also, I will ask about experiences with human mentoring or coaching and also AI tools for career support. There are no right answers, just your experience. Ready?
Sofia: Yes. Ready.
2) Participant context and career situation
Anna: To start, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now, or recently faced?
Sofia: Eehm, so I am 27. I moved to Hamburg three years ago from Spain for my Master’s in Business Analytics. I finished last year. And now I work in e-commerce as a data specialist. In my company the title is Data Specialist, but it is basically marketing analytics, like growth marketing analytics.
Anna: Aha. 
Sofia: And, um, I like the analysis part a lot. Like, I genuinely enjoy when there is messy data and you have to make it make sense. But I am not super comfortable with the, how to say, the storytelling to stakeholders. Like presenting to product managers or marketing leads, or leadership, that makes me anxious.
Anna: Can you say a bit more about what kind of situations trigger that anxiety?
Sofia: Yeah. So, we have weekly KPI meetings. It is fast paced, like every week is campaigns, promotions, seasonality, and everyone wants answers fast. And I have dashboards and analysis, and sometimes I am asked to, like, explain why conversion dropped in a certain segment, or why CAC changed, or why ROAS is not meeting target. And I know the analysis, but when I have to explain it in front of people who are very confident and very quick, I get, um, in my head.
Anna: What goes through your head in those moments?
Sofia: Like, I am thinking, okay, do I sound naive? Do I sound like I do not understand business? Also language. I speak English at work mostly, but there is always some German words and some jokes and, like, these small nuances. My German is, eehm, B1 maybe, like I can handle daily life, but in meetings I do not jump in German. So sometimes I feel behind.
Anna: Thank you. What is a career decision you faced in the last, say, six to twelve months?
Sofia: Yes. So, around, maybe, September or October last year, I had this decision. I was doing mainly reporting and campaign performance, like weekly dashboards, and I felt I was becoming, um, a dashboard person. And I wanted to grow into a bridge role, like someone who can translate analytics to business decisions. Like analytics translator, analytics PM, strategy ops with data. But I was not sure how to move there from my current role.
Anna: So what did you consider doing?
Sofia: I considered applying internally to product analytics, because product analytics is closer to feature decisions. But then I was like, wait, I will still have to present to stakeholders, maybe even more. And then I considered asking my manager to give me more exposure, like not just sending slides, but presenting, leading parts of the meeting. That felt scary.
Anna: What did you end up doing?
Sofia: I did a bit of both. I did not apply internally yet. I had a conversation with my manager, and I asked for more stakeholder exposure, like I said, I want to own one KPI narrative end to end. Like not just numbers, but the story. And she said yes, but then I had to do it. 
Anna: How did that go?
Sofia: The first time was bad in my head, but it was okay in reality. Like I prepared too much. I wrote a script almost. And then in the meeting, the Head of Marketing, he is German, very direct, he interrupted me and asked, so what do we do now? Like, he wanted action. And I froze for one second. And then I said, okay, we test creative A versus B, we adjust bid strategy, and we check attribution window. But my voice, I could hear it shaking.
Anna: What did you take away from that moment?
Sofia: That analysis depth is not enough. People want decision speed. They want, like, a recommendation, even if it is imperfect. And I can do that, but I need confidence. And also I need to feel safe. Like if someone interrupts and it feels aggressive, I interpret it as I failed.
Anna: When you say safe, what would create that safety for you?
Sofia: Um, if someone signals, it is okay to think, it is okay to not know everything. Like, if my manager says, we are exploring, not defending. But in those meetings it feels like defending.
3) Career support in general
Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Sofia: Eehm, friends. I have two close friends in Hamburg, one is also in tech. And I call my mom. My mom is in Spain, in Valencia region, like near Alicante, and she is very supportive. She is like, Sofia, you are capable, you moved countries, you did a Master’s, you can do this. She is very, how to say, ground?
Anna: What kind of support does your mom give you, practically?
Sofia: She gives emotional reassurance. Like she listens. And she also gives like, values advice. Like, she asks, what kind of life do you want? Do you want stability, do you want growth, do you want people around you? She is not in analytics, so she cannot give specific career tips, but she makes me calmer.
Anna: Anything else besides friends and your mom?
Sofia: Sometimes online resources, like LinkedIn posts, but honestly it overwhelms me. Everyone is like, you must do this, you must do that. So I avoid. And then, yes, I have used AI sometimes, like ChatGPT, and now I use Cursor a lot for vibe coding, building small agents. But that is more for work and also, like, for career brainstorming when I am overwhelmed.
Anna: Before we go to AI, tell me about human support. Have you used any mentoring or coaching?
Sofia: Yes. I tried mentoring via a women-in-tech network in Hamburg. It was like a programme, they matched you with a mentor.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust
Anna: Tell me about that mentoring. What was the setup, and what were you hoping to get?
Sofia: It was supposed to be, like, six months. One call per month, plus maybe messages in between. I wanted guidance on how to grow from data specialist into a more business bridging role. And also confidence, like how to speak up, how to present. Like, not therapy, but more, um, career mentoring.
Anna: What happened in the beginning?
Sofia: In the beginning it was great. I got matched with a mentor, she worked in a bigger company, like a marketplace, in analytics leadership. She was also Spanish, actually, which was, like, wow, instant connection. We spoke Spanglish sometimes. And she was very warm. She asked me questions, she remembered details. That made me trust her fast.
Anna: What specifically made you trust her?
Sofia: Feeling seen. Like she did not treat me like a generic mentee. She asked about my team, the meeting culture, my language situation. And she was credible, like she had done the path. Also confidentiality. She explicitly said, what we talk about stays here. That made me relax.
Anna: Was it effective?
Sofia: Um, partly. It was motivating. After the first call I felt, like, I can do it. She gave me some frameworks, like, prepare three bullets: insight, impact, action. And she suggested I ask my manager for more exposure. That was actually useful.
Anna: And then you said it became inconsistent.
Sofia: Yes. So after maybe two calls, it became messy. She started cancelling. Like, one time she cancelled 30 minutes before because she had a leadership meeting. And I understand, but then we rescheduled and she cancelled again. And then the programme coordinators said, okay, you can switch mentor if needed.
Anna: How did that affect you?
Sofia: It broke the trust in reliability. Like I still liked her as a person. So, this is interesting, I trusted her in the sense I felt safe and I thought she is a good person. But it was not effective anymore because there was no follow through. Like no accountability, no continuity.
Anna: Did you switch mentors?
Sofia: Yes. They switched me to another mentor. She was German, very direct, very structured. She was like, okay, what is your goal, what is your plan, send me your CV, we will review. That was, um, in some way effective, because she pushed me. But I did not trust her emotionally.
Anna: What made it hard to trust her?
Sofia: She felt judgemental, maybe not intentionally. Like she would say, why did you not do this already? And I was like, eehm, because I am scared? Hahaha. But I did not want to say that. Also she did not remember details. It felt transactional.
Anna: So would you say that mentor was effective but not trusted?
Sofia: Yes, exactly. Like, she gave concrete tasks. She told me to write a stakeholder update email in a certain format. And it worked. My manager liked it. So effective. But I did not feel warm. I did not feel safe. So I did not share the deeper anxiety.
Anna: And the first mentor, trusted but not effective, at least later on?
Sofia: Yes. Trusted, but not effective because no continuity. I still think she is great, but it did not help my career problem in the end.
Anna: Did you have any other human support, like a paid coach, university career services?
Sofia: I used the university career service once in the Master’s. It was okay, but very generic. Like, they gave me CV tips, but not specific to analytics in Germany. And also, I did not fully trust them because it felt like they do it for everyone.
Anna: Did it help anyway?
Sofia: A little. Like, they helped me format the CV and explain German CV conventions. That was useful, even if I did not trust them deeply. So, maybe that is human help that is effective despite low trust. It was effective for the task, but I did not feel a relationship.
Anna: Thank you that is good for distinction.
5) AI tools: experience and trust

Anna: Now let’s talk about AI tools for career support. What have you used, and in what situations?
Sofia: Mostly ChatGPT, and also I use Cursor a lot. But for career support specifically, ChatGPT. When I am overwhelmed, like I have too many options and I cannot think.
Anna: Can you give me a concrete moment when AI helped?
Sofia: Yes. In November, I had a week where I felt, like, I am stuck. I was comparing roles like analytics PM, strategy and ops, product analyst, and I was like, I do not know what fits me. And I was also tired from work. So I opened ChatGPT and I wrote, I am a data specialist in e-commerce in Hamburg, I like analysis but fear presentations, I want a bridge role, what options exist and what steps to test them.
Anna: And what did it do?
Sofia: It gave structure. Like, it made a table. It suggested informational interviews, internal projects, asking to shadow product meetings, building a small portfolio, like case studies. And it suggested a weekly plan, like week 1 identify roles, week 2 talk to manager, week 3 update CV, etc. That calmed me.
Anna: Did you act on it?
Sofia: Yes, partially. I used it to draft a message to my manager, like a Slack message. I was like, can I take ownership of the KPI narrative for retention next month, and can we define success. It drafted something that sounded confident.
Anna: How did you feel sending that?
Sofia: Nervous but it helped. And then I double checked with my friend and my mom. My mom was like, it sounds professional, but make it more you, like not too robotic. 
Anna: So you use AI but validate with humans.
Sofia: Yes. For important decisions, I need human validation. Even if AI is helpful, I do not fully trust it.
Anna: What makes you not fully trust it?
Sofia: Context and accuracy. Like, sometimes it assumes US style, or it assumes I can just switch jobs easily. Or it suggests things that do not fit German culture, like being super assertive in a way that can be seen as arrogant here. Also it can sound too polished. And then I worry, if I speak like that, people will think it is fake.
Anna: Can you describe a moment AI failed for you?
Sofia: Yes. I asked it once, like, how to prepare for a stakeholder meeting with a German leadership team. And it gave me advice that was generic, like, be confident, tell a story, use visuals. And it suggested I open with a personal anecdote. And I was like, hmm, in my company, leadership does not want personal anecdotes. They want numbers.  So it felt wrong.
Anna: Anything else?
Sofia: Another time it suggested salary ranges that were, I think, unrealistic. It was like, you can earn X, and I was like, I do not know if that is true in Hamburg for my experience. So I did not trust it. But it still gave me, like, negotiation phrases. That part was useful.
Anna: That sounds like effective but not trusted.
Sofia: Exactly. Like I take the structure and the wording, but I do not trust the facts.
Anna: You mentioned Cursor and vibe coding. How does that connect to your work, and maybe also your confidence?
Sofia: Oh yes. So I am kind of obsessed. I use Cursor to build small agents, like, um, scripts that help me at work. For example, I built an agent that drafts SQL queries from a question. Like, I write, I need conversion by channel by week, excluding returns, and it drafts a query. I still review, but it saves time.
Anna: What else?
Sofia: I built a reporting narrative generator. So, every Monday I have to send a summary of campaign performance. I created a template where the agent reads the metrics from a CSV and writes a first draft narrative, like, this week ROAS increased due to X, but CAC rose in Y segment, recommended action is Z. It is not perfect, but it gives me a starting point.
Anna: Interesting. Any agents for meetings?
Sofia: Yes. I have a meeting prep checklist agent. I paste the meeting title and attendees, and it generates, like, what do they care about, what questions might they ask, what risks, what one slide summary. And also I made a stakeholder FAQ generator. It creates a list of likely objections, like, is this statistically significant, what about seasonality, what about attribution. That helps my anxiety because I feel prepared.
Anna: Does it reduce anxiety in presentations?
Sofia: A bit. It gives me confidence because I have answers ready. But also it can make me over prepare. Like, I have 20 possible questions and then I am more stressed. 
Anna: You also said you believe many problems can be solved with AI.
Sofia: Yes, I kind of do. Like, not emotions, but a lot of work problems, planning problems, writing problems. I love building agents. It makes me feel powerful, like I can create my own support system.
Anna: And privacy, how do you think about that?
Sofia: Eehm. I understand it matters. Like GDPR, and company data, and personal data. But honestly, sometimes I ignore it because it is easier.  Like, I try not to paste sensitive data, but I probably do more than I should. It is like, I know it is important, but I also want speed. And then I laugh it off like, okay, Sofia, you will go to jail. Hahahah. But yeah, I know it is not ideal.
Anna: So there is awareness, but convenience wins?
Sofia:  Aha 
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: I want to compare human mentoring and AI support through specific tasks. Let’s take a few common career support tasks. First, clarifying options. If you feel stuck and you need to map options, who or what do you prefer?
Sofia: AI first. Because it is fast and non judgemental. I can dump everything, like, I am confused, I hate presenting, I like analysis, and it will not react like, what is wrong with you.It just structures.
Anna: And then?
Sofia: Then human, to validate. Like my friend or my mom, or ideally a mentor who is consistent.
Anna: Second task, making a high stakes decision, like applying internally or asking for a role change. Who do you rely on?
Sofia: Human more. Because I need reassurance and also context. Like, my friend knows my company culture. AI does not.
Anna: Third task, preparing for stakeholder presentations. Who helps more?
Sofia: This one is mixed. AI helps with structure, like the storyline, and anticipating questions. But a human helps with delivery, like confidence, tone, and what is realistic in the room.
Anna: What about practical tasks like CV rewriting or drafting messages?
Sofia: AI is very effective there. It can rewrite, it can produce versions. But I do not fully trust it because it can sound too perfect, too American. So I edit. Also I sometimes ask the German mentor style person, like, is this wording okay. She is effective for that even if I do not trust her emotionally.
Anna: So you use both, depending on the task.
Sofia: Yes. AI for speed and drafts. Humans for context and emotional safety.
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness. In your experience, how does trust affect whether something is effective?
Sofia: Trust is like, um, permission. If I trust a mentor, I tell the real story. Like, I say, I am scared, I feel stupid, I do not understand the meeting dynamics. And then they can help. If I do not trust, I only talk about safe topics, like CV. Then it is less effective.
Anna: And for AI?
Sofia: For AI, trust is different. I do not need emotional trust. I need to trust accuracy and that it is not misleading me. If I do not trust it, I still might use it for structure, but I will not follow advice blindly.
Anna: Can you give an example where you trusted but it was not effective?
Sofia: Yes, the first mentor in the women-in-tech programme. I trusted her as a person. I felt warmth. But it became not effective because she was not reliable, and advice stayed vague, like, be confident, you can do it, and then no follow up. So I felt good but nothing changed.
Anna: And effective but not trusted?
Sofia: AI sometimes. Like the negotiation phrases. Or the plan for internal move. It was effective because it gave me steps. But I did not trust that it understood Germany or my company. So I double checked with humans. Another example is the second mentor, the German one. She was effective with concrete tasks, but I did not trust her enough to share the deeper anxiety.
Anna: You also mentioned human support that was effective despite low trust, like university career services.
Sofia: Yes. They helped with German CV format. I did not trust them as, like, knowing my life, but they were effective for that task.
Anna: When you think about perceived effectiveness, how do you define it for yourself?
Sofia: If it leads to action and better outcomes. Like, I feel clearer, I do the next step, I perform better in meetings, I get better feedback from my manager, or I get interview callbacks. Also confidence. Like, if I can present and not panic, that is effectiveness.
Anna: Does trust always lead to effectiveness in your opinion?
Sofia: Not always. I mean , trust can make me feel better but not change behaviour. Like, emotional comfort without structure is not enough. And effectiveness can happen without full trust, like a useful template. But for deep career decisions, trust is necessary, because I need to share real things.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction (including micro-poll ratings)

Anna: I want to do a quick micro poll, just short. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is complete trust, how would you rate your trust in human coaches or mentors, in general, for your career situation?
Sofia: Um. I would say 7. Because I believe humans can understand. But I also had inconsistency. So not 9.
Anna: What drives that 7?
Sofia: Warmth, feeling seen, credibility, like they know the path. Also accountability. But I deduct points because reliability is not guaranteed and sometimes advice is generic.
Anna: Same scale, trust in AI tools for career support?
Sofia: Maybe 5.5. Hahaha. Is half allowed?
Anna: Totally fine. Why 5.5?
Sofia: Speed, structure, low judgement, repeatability. I can ask again and again. But questionable accuracy and context. And sometimes it sounds too confident and I get suspicious.
Anna: Now perceived effectiveness. Same 0 to 10. Effectiveness of human mentoring or coaching for your situation.
Sofia: I would say 6. Because when it works, it is amazing. But I had inconsistency. And also sometimes humans are supportive but vague.
Anna: And effectiveness of AI tools for your situation?
Sofia: I would say 7. Which is funny because trust is lower. But effectiveness is higher for some tasks.
Anna: That is interesting. Why 7?
Sofia: Because it helps me move when I am stuck. It gives me drafts, plans, options. It reduces overwhelm. But I still validate with humans.
Anna: That separation is exactly what I want to understand. Now imagine a hybrid model. For example, you have an AI that helps you clarify options, prepare messages, and build a plan. And then you have a human mentor or coach who steps in for key decisions, emotional support, and accountability. How does that sound?
Sofia: That sounds ideal. Like, AI as the always available assistant, and human as the real anchor.
Anna: What would make you adopt it?
Sofia: Reliability of the human part. Like consistent mentor. Also clear boundaries. Like, when does AI handle and when does human handle. And transparency about privacy. Even though I laugh it off, I still want to know. Like, what happens to my data. If it is clear, I feel safer.
Anna: What would make you hesitate?
Sofia: If it feels like AI is replacing the human, like I cannot access a person when I need. Or if the human is too expensive or too unavailable. Also if the AI gives wrong assumptions and pushes me in a direction that does not fit me.
Anna: In a hybrid model, what tasks would you assign to AI, and what tasks to a human?
Sofia: AI: brainstorming options, structuring my thoughts, drafting messages, CV versions, interview prep questions, meeting prep checklist, stakeholder FAQ, like all that. Human: role strategy, reading company politics, helping me with confidence and presentation delivery, and accountability, like, did you actually do the thing.
Anna: When you say accountability, what would that look like?
Sofia: Like, if I say, I will talk to my manager next week, the human asks me, did you do it, what happened, what do you need now. AI can remind me, but it does not feel the same.
Anna: Why not?
Sofia: Because I do not want to disappoint a real person. AI does not care.
9) Closing

Anna: We are almost at the end. Is there anything important about trust or effectiveness in career support that we did not cover?
Sofia: Maybe one thing. I think I am optimistic about AI. I genuinely think we can solve many problems with AI, especially work problems. Like I love building agents. But for career, it is not only logic. It is identity. It is fear. And then I need a human to say, you are not crazy, you are allowed to want this. AI cannot really give that, even if it tries.
Anna: That is helpful. If you could design the perfect support for someone like you in Hamburg in e-commerce analytics, what would it look like?
Sofia: It would be like, AI gives me a structure and helps me prepare. And then a mentor who understands both data and business, and who is consistent, and who helps me practice presentations. Like maybe role play. And also understands I am not native in German, so gives me language tips without making me feel stupid.
Anna: Last question. If you think back to your stakeholder anxiety, what would be one small improvement that would change a lot for you?
Sofia: Practice with someone safe. Like rehearsing the narrative. And having a clear, simple recommendation. Like not trying to be perfect. If I can say, here is the insight, here is the impact, here is what we do, then I feel more in control.
Anna: Thank you, Sofia. That was very insightful. After I stop recording, if you think of anything else you want to add, you can message me.
Sofia: Thank you. It was actually nice to talk. I feel


Jonas 


1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Jonas. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything is anonymous, you can skip any question, and you can stop anytime.
Jonas: Yeah, um, yes. You can record. That is fine.
Anna: Thank you. Just to double check, you are comfortable that this is for a master thesis study about trust and perceived effectiveness in AI-based versus human career coaching, and we keep it pseudonymized.
Jonas: Yes. As long as it is really anonymized, I am okay.
Anna: It will be. If any detail feels too identifying, tell me and we can rephrase. Also, are there any topics you would prefer not to discuss?
Jonas:Eehm. I think I do not want to go into very detailed security stuff. I had one incident and it made me kind of, yeah, paranoid. But I can talk about it in general.
Anna: Perfect. We will keep it high level. And just so you know, I will ask about both human support and AI tools, but you decide what you want to share.
Jonas: Okay.
Anna: Great. Let us start with a bit of context.
2)  Participant context and career situation

Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing, or recently faced?
Jonas: Okay. So I am Jonas, I am 28, and I work as a backend developer in a fintech scale-up here in Cologne. I studied Computer Science, Bachelor, also in NRW. I have, um, around five and a half years experience full-time, if you count internships it is more, but yeah. And the big question for me right now is, like, what is next. Because I am technically strong, that is my thing, and I like building systems, I like clean code, architecture, performance, reliability. But in our company there is this expectation that at some point you either go into a lead role or you kind of stay forever in the same level. And I do not want to stagnate.
Anna: When you say lead role, what does that mean in your company?
Jonas: That is already part of the problem. It is not super clear. We have titles like Senior Engineer, Staff Engineer, Team Lead, Engineering Manager. But the boundaries are fuzzy. Sometimes Team Lead is also writing a lot of code, sometimes it is basically a mini-manager who does Jira and meetings. And that is my fear.
Anna: What is the fear exactly?
Jonas: I fear becoming a manager with an office job, you know. Like, no creativity. Just meetings, status updates, people problems. And I do not mean that in a disrespectful way, but I enjoy craft. I enjoy building. If I imagine my week is all meetings and, like, spreadsheets and performance reviews, I feel, um, trapped. I need creativity. I like solving problems, designing things. Even debugging can feel creative, in a weird way.
Anna: Can you give me an example of when that fear shows up in daily work?
Jonas: Yes. Like, we have these planning meetings, refinement, retro, sync with product, sync with compliance, and then leadership sync. And sometimes I look at my Team Lead, and he is in meetings all day. And then he maybe reviews a PR at night. And he is stressed. And when I see that, I think, if this is the path, I do not want it. I do not want to be the person who cannot open an IDE during the day.
Anna: And what is the decision you faced in the last six to twelve months related to this?
Jonas: So in the last, um, maybe eight months, I had an offer from another company, not fintech, more like e-commerce infrastructure. They wanted me as Senior Backend Engineer with more ownership. And I seriously considered leaving. Because in our scale-up it is intense, and there is a lot of ambiguity. But then I decided to stay, because I negotiated internally to get more scope. Like, more ownership of a core service, and also a clearer path to some leadership that is more technical. That was the decision.
Anna: What made it difficult?
Jonas: Uncertainty. Like, what is better. In a scale-up, growth is fast, you learn a lot, but also you can burn out. And in fintech, the stakes are high. Production incidents are scary. Compliance, audits, security, it is not just, oh we deploy and see. It can be, if we mess up, there are real consequences. So the question was, do I stay in the intense environment but maybe grow faster, or do I go somewhere calmer. And also, I was not sure if I am actually good for leadership, or if I just like the idea of it.And there was money too, obviously.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed at that time?
Jonas: I needed someone to help me see the options clearly and not just emotionally. Like, to reflect, okay, what do you want, what are your values, what is realistic. And also very practical, like negotiation. I am not naturally a negotiator. I can argue about architecture, but not about salary. 
Anna: That is a common split. Before we go into support, can you describe your current work setup a bit. Team, domain, maybe tech stack.
Jonas: Sure. We are a fintech in payments. Like, we provide payment processing for small and mid businesses. There is also some lending products, but my area is payments and settlement. Backend stack is mostly Kotlin and Java, Spring Boot, some older services in Java 8, we are migrating slowly. We use Kafka for events, Postgres, Redis. Some things in AWS, but we are moving parts to a more controlled environment because of compliance. Observability is decent, we have Grafana, Prometheus, logging, alerts. And team setup, we have squads, like cross-functional with product and design. My squad is backend heavy because payments are complex.
Anna: And how is it in Cologne, work-wise. Hybrid, office, tech community?
Jonas: We are hybrid. Office in Cologne, but many people are remote, also Berlin, Munich, even some in Spain. Cologne tech scene is smaller than Berlin, but there are meetups. I go sometimes to a Kotlin meetup or general backend meetups. Fintech is there, also insurtech, but it is not like London. Still, you know people. Sometimes you meet someone and they are like, oh I know your company, you had that incident. 
Anna: You mentioned production incidents. Is that part of the leadership pressure?
Jonas: Yes. Because when things break, someone needs to coordinate, decide, communicate. And that is leadership. And it is stressful. But also, that can be meaningful, like you feel responsible. So there is attraction and fear.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Jonas: First, friends in tech. Like, peers. We talk. Sometimes my girlfriend, but she is not in tech, so it is more emotional support. Then sometimes seniors at work, if I trust them. I do not really use official career coaching. I never went to a paid career coach. And I do not use AI for career stuff. For work, yes. For career, no.
Anna: What has actually helped, and what felt unhelpful or frustrating?
Jonas: Helpful is when someone understands the context. Like fintech, scale-up, German market, salary ranges, and also company politics. Unhelpful is generic advice like, just be confident, just apply, just network. Like, thanks. I know. But how. Also sometimes people project their own path onto you. Like, they became manager so they think you must. But maybe I do not.
Anna: So you prefer practical and context-aware support.
Jonas: Exactly. And also honesty. If someone tells me, yeah you would be a great manager, but they do not really know me, that feels like empty motivation.
Anna :Do you use any resources, like blogs, books, forums?
Jonas: Some. I read about engineering career ladders. Staff Engineer path, that stuff. There is a book, Staff Engineer, and also blogs from big tech. But then I think, okay, that is Google, not a German fintech. So it helps, but limited.
Anna: What about internal resources, like HR, performance frameworks?
Jonas:We have a career ladder doc, but it is, um, aspirational. It says, as Team Lead you do mentoring, planning, stakeholder management. As Staff Engineer you do cross-team architecture. But in practice, it is messy. So it gives vocabulary, but not a clear plan.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust

Anna: You mentioned that you had informal mentoring from a senior engineer. Can you tell me about that experience?
Jonas: Yes. So, in my previous team, we had a senior engineer, I will call him Markus, not real name. He was, like, very calm, very solid. He had been in fintech before, also in a bank. And we started talking because I was struggling with scope. I was doing a lot of on-call, a lot of incidents, and also feature work. And I felt I was drowning. So I asked him, how do you handle this, and how do you position yourself.
Anna: Was it formal mentoring, or just informal?
Jonas: Informal. Like, coffee chats. Sometimes after a retro, we would stay 15 minutes. Sometimes we booked 30 minutes. It was not like a program.
Anna: Can you describe one specific episode where this mentoring built trust for you?
Jonas: Yes. There was a moment when I got my performance review, and I was told, you are doing great technically, but you need to show more leadership. And I was like, what does that mean. And also, my salary increase was lower than I expected. So I was angry, but also unsure if I am being unrealistic. I talked to Markus, and he did not just hype me. He asked very concrete questions. Like, what exactly did they say, what did you deliver, what is the market rate, what is your leverage. And he also shared his own numbers, like his salary range, which is kind of sensitive. That was a big trust moment, because he took a risk for me.
Anna: What did he do, behavior-wise, that made you trust him?
Jonas: He was honest and not ego-driven. He did not try to be the hero. He also said, I do not know everything, but here is what I would do. And he listened. He did not jump to solutions. Also confidentiality. He explicitly said, this stays between us, I will not talk to your manager. That matters. Because in a scale-up, gossip travels fast.
Anna: What advice did he give you in that salary and scope situation?
Jonas: He gave me a plan. First, separate emotions from facts. Second, write down my impact. Like, not just I wrote code, but I reduced incident frequency, improved latency, mentored juniors, improved test coverage. Third, decide what I want. Do I want more money, or more scope, or both. Fourth, schedule a meeting with my manager, not in a reactive way, but prepared. And he helped me with wording. Like, how to say, I want to grow into a lead path, and for that I need ownership, and compensation aligned with market.
Anna: And what changed afterwards?
Jonas: I negotiated. I got a better raise, not huge, but meaningful. And more important, we adjusted my role scope. I became the owner of a service, settlement reconciliation, which is critical. And they also reduced my on-call rotation frequency. So I got more time for deep work. That was a tangible outcome. And mentally, I felt more confident. Like, I can advocate for myself.
Anna: So that mentoring felt effective.
Jonas: Yes, for that task, very effective.
Anna: Were there any moments where you trusted him but it was not effective?
Jonas: Yes. He is very technical, and sometimes when I ask about, like, people leadership or stakeholder stuff, his advice becomes generic. Like, just communicate more, build relationships. He is not bad, but it is not detailed. So I trust him as a person and as an engineer, but not everything he says is actionable for me.
Anna: That is interesting. So trust and effectiveness are related but not the same.
Jonas: Exactly. I can respect someone and still not get what I need.
Anna: What are, for you, the main drivers of trust for a human coach or mentor?
Jonas: Competence, but competence in my context. Like, understands fintech constraints, understands German work culture, understands scale-up chaos. Honesty. If they are unsure, they say it. Confidentiality. If I share career fears, I need it to stay safe. Consistent follow-up. Like, if we talk and they remember next time, that shows they care. And also, not ego-driven. Some seniors love to talk and show how smart they are. That kills trust for me.
Anna: And what makes someone untrustworthy?
Jonas: If they are political. If they use mentoring to recruit you to their agenda. Or if they promise things. Like, do this and you will get promoted. Nobody can promise that. Or if they share other people’s private info, because then I think they will share mine too.
Anna: How did you feel during those mentoring conversations, emotionally?
Jonas: Safer. Like, less alone. In German I would say, erleichtert. Because you realize, okay, it is not just me. Also, it gave structure. In a scale-up, everything is urgent. Mentoring gave me a step back.
5) AI tools: experience and trust 
Anna: Now shifting to AI tools. What is your experience with AI tools, and how do you use them?
Jonas: I use AI a lot for coding. Like, daily. Not because I blindly trust it, but because it speeds things up. I use it for unit tests, integration test scaffolding, refactoring suggestions, generating boilerplate, sometimes explaining an unfamiliar library. Also for code review, like, can you spot potential issues. I also use it to draft documentation.
Anna: Which kinds of tools, in general terms? Like integrated in IDE or web-based?
Jonas: Both. In IDE, like a coding assistant. Also sometimes a chat interface. But I am careful. For work code, I do not paste sensitive stuff. We have policies. And personally, because of my privacy thing, I try to limit what I share.
Anna: We will get to privacy. Before that, can you give me a moment where AI really helped you on a technical task?
Jonas: Yes. Recently we had a performance issue in a Kafka consumer. Under load, we had spikes, and the consumer lag went crazy. I suspected some blocking call. I asked the AI to help me reason about a certain pattern in Kotlin coroutines, like where blocking might happen if you mix coroutine context with a legacy library. It suggested a few things, and one of them was correct: we had a hidden blocking call in a mapping function that did synchronous network calls. I had overlooked it. So it helped me look in the right place. Then I fixed it by moving that call to an async pipeline and adding caching. That reduced lag significantly.
Anna: So it was not just code generation, but also diagnosis.
Jonas: Exactly. Like a second brain, but not always right.
Anna: And can you share a moment when AI failed or was risky?
Jonas: Many. Hahaha. One example: I asked for a refactor of a piece of code that handles money amounts, like decimals, currency. It suggested using float. And I was like, no. That is dangerous. Another time it hallucinated an API that does not exist. Like, it confidently said, use this method, and it was fake. That is the problem. It can look correct but be wrong. In fintech, that is scary. Also security. It sometimes suggests patterns that are not safe, like logging too much, or ignoring validation.
Anna: How do you handle that risk?
Jonas: Verification. I treat it like a junior developer with confidence. I check documentation. I run tests. I reason myself. It is helpful for speed, but I do not outsource judgment.
Anna: How would you describe your trust in AI tools in technical contexts?
Jonas: Conditional. I trust it for ideas, for drafts, for boilerplate. I do not trust it for correctness without verification. And I definitely do not trust it for sensitive data.
Anna: You said you avoid using AI for career topics. Why?
Jonas: Two reasons. One is privacy. Career topics are personal. The second is, I have this feeling it reinforces what you already believe. Like confirmation bias. If I ask, should I become a team lead, it will give me a nice answer that fits my question framing. And if I am in a mood, I might just select the parts that comfort me. It is like a mirror. And I do not want that. I want friction, sometimes. I want someone to challenge me.
Anna: Can you give a concrete example where you noticed that effect?
Jonas: Yes. I tried once. Just once. I asked something like, I am afraid management will kill my creativity, how can I grow without becoming a manager. And it gave me a very well-written answer, like, you can become Staff Engineer, you can mentor, you can do architecture. And it felt good. But then I realized, it just validated my fear. It did not ask, maybe your picture of management is wrong, maybe there is creative leadership. It could have, but it did not. And I did not push it. I just took the comforting answer. That is exactly the risk. It is too agreeable if you do not structure it.
Anna: So it can be soothing, but maybe not corrective.
Jonas: Yes. And for career decisions, I need something that reduces self-delusion, not increases it.
Anna: That is a strong statement. Let us talk about the privacy concern you mentioned earlier. You said you had a past incident where your email was compromised.
Jonas: Yes.
Anna: Can you describe it at a high level, what happened and how it changed your behavior?
Jonas: High level. So, a few years ago, I noticed weird login notifications. Like, password reset emails I did not request. Then I realized my email account had been accessed. And because email is the key to everything, they tried to reset other accounts too. Some passwords were reused, which is stupid, I know, and so some accounts were accessed. It was not catastrophic, but it was invasive. I felt, um, violated. Like, someone is in your digital home.
Anna: That sounds intense. What did you do afterwards?
Jonas: I changed everything. Password manager, unique passwords, 2FA everywhere, also a hardware key for important accounts. I stopped trusting cloud services blindly. I started thinking in threat models, like, what happens if this is leaked. And I became very cautious about sharing personal info in tools that store data. That includes AI tools. Because I do not fully know where the prompts go, who can access, how long it is stored. Even if they say it is private, I am cautious.
Anna: So your trust drivers for AI include data boundaries.
Jonas: Yes. If an AI tool is local, like running on my machine, I feel more trust. If it is cloud, I assume it is stored somewhere. Also, verifiability. Like, can I see sources, can I see reasoning. And clear policies.
Anna: Do you use any local AI tools?
Jonas: A bit. For experimenting. Not super powerful compared to cloud, but for some tasks, yes. And for work, we have approved tools, but still, I am cautious.
6)  Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: Now I want to compare human and AI via specific career-related tasks. I will name a task, and you tell me which you would prefer, and why. Does that work?
Jonas: Yes.
Anna: Task one is clarifying options. Like, you are unsure whether to pursue Staff Engineer, Team Lead, or change company. Who would you go to?
Jonas: Human. Because I need questions back. I need someone to explore my assumptions. AI can list options, but I can also Google that. Human can say, okay, but what do you actually want, and why. And they can notice contradictions.
Anna: What if the human does not know fintech?
Jonas: Then less useful. Context matters. But still, a good human can facilitate reflection.
Anna: Task two: planning concrete next steps for a lead path, like what skills, what projects, what timeline.
Jonas: This is mixed. AI could help structure a plan, like a checklist. But I would want a human to validate it in my company context. Because in a scale-up, formal checklists are sometimes fake. So I would use AI for a draft, but then human for reality check.
Anna: Task three: negotiating salary and role scope.
Jonas: Human, definitely. Because negotiation is social. I need to practice, role-play, get feedback on tone. Also, a human can share market knowledge. AI can give generic tips, but it cannot tell me what my manager is likely to react to.
Anna: Task four: CV rewriting or LinkedIn polishing.
Jonas: AI, actually. For that, it is fine. Because it is not deeply personal, and it is pattern-based. But I would still not paste everything. I would anonymize. AI can generate bullet points and wording. Human can also help, but AI is faster.
Anna: Task five: making a high-stakes decision when you are emotionally stressed, like you are burnt out and thinking of quitting.
Jonas: Human. Because I need emotional containment. AI cannot really do that. It can write empathetic text, but I do not feel it. And I do not want to share that level of vulnerability with a system I do not trust.
Anna: What about task six: technical career growth, like becoming a better engineer, learning architecture.
Jonas: Here AI is effective. Like, for technical learning, it is great. But again, verify. It can explain patterns, show examples. For that, I trust it more.
Anna: So there is a split between technical and personal.
Jonas: Yes. For me, AI is a tool for technical tasks. For career identity, leadership, values, I prefer human.
Anna: Can you think of a situation where AI was effective for you but you still did not fully trust it?
Jonas: Yes. Like the performance debugging I mentioned. It helped. It was effective. But I still do not trust it as a system with my sensitive info. So effectiveness in one domain does not automatically create trust in another.
Anna: And the opposite, trusted but not effective, you mentioned with Markus and generic advice.
Jonas: Exactly. I trust Markus. But he cannot always give me the detailed leadership model I need.
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human mentoring, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Jonas: Trust is like the entry ticket. If I do not trust the person, I will not share the real thing. I will talk about safe topics, like how to improve my CV, but not the deeper fears. And without the deeper stuff, advice is shallow. So trust enables depth. And depth is often where effectiveness comes from.
Anna: What does depth mean for you in this context?
Jonas: Depth is like, why do I fear management. Is it because I saw a bad example. Is it because I fear losing identity. Is it because I do not want responsibility. These are uncomfortable. If I trust the mentor, I can say, I am scared. If I do not trust, I will say, I am considering career options, which is a polite lie. 
Anna: And with AI, how does trust connect to effectiveness?
Jonas: Different. With AI, trust is more about, can I rely on output and can I control my data. For technical tasks, I can get effectiveness without emotional trust, because I can verify. For career tasks, if I do not trust privacy, I will not even use it. So it cannot be effective because it is not used. Or I will sanitize so much that it becomes generic, and then it is not effective anyway.
Anna: So trust can be a prerequisite for use.
Jonas: Yes. Especially in personal domains.
Anna: What are your indicators that support was effective, whether human or AI?
Jonas: Clarity. Like, I know what I want to do next. Concrete next steps. Like, I will take ownership of project X, I will mentor someone, I will talk to my manager with these points. Also confidence. Not fake confidence, but grounded. And results, like my negotiation outcome. Also skill growth, like I learn how to communicate better.
Anna: Do you think trust can ever be too high, like overtrust, leading to bad outcomes?
Jonas: Yes. If you trust a mentor too much, you can take their path as yours. Especially if they are charismatic. That is risky. And with AI, overtrust is super risky because it can hallucinate. So I think appropriate trust is key, not just more trust.
Anna: Interesting. In your case, you described skepticism and verification.
Jonas: Yes. I am not a trusting person with systems. With humans, I can trust, but it takes time.
Anna: If you imagine an ideal support for your team lead path question, what would it look like?
Jonas: It would be someone who has seen different models. Like technical lead, staff engineer, engineering manager. And they can describe daily life, not just title. Like, what do you do on a Tuesday. How much code. How much people. And they can help me experiment, like take a temporary leadership responsibility without fully committing. And they can challenge my assumptions about creativity.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction (plus micro-poll ratings)

Anna: Now I will ask you for some quick ratings, 0 to 10. It is not a test, just to structure the conversation. And I will ask you to explain. Is that okay?
Jonas: Yes.
Anna: First, current trust in human coaches or mentors for career topics, 0 to 10.
Jonas: I would say, um, 7.
Anna: Why 7, not higher or lower?
Jonas: Because with the right person, I trust quite a lot. Like Markus, I would say 8 or 9. But in general, I do not automatically trust a coach. There is a whole market of coaches, and I do not know their incentives. And also, some people are just not good. So overall, 7.
Anna:Second, current trust in AI tools, 0 to 10.
Jonas: Overall trust, like as a system, maybe 4.
Anna: What drives the 4?
Jonas: Privacy concerns and hallucinations. Also, I do not know boundaries. For coding assistance, I trust specific outputs after checking, but the system trust is low.
Anna: Third, perceived effectiveness of human coaching or mentoring for your situation, 0 to 10.
Jonas: For my situation, maybe 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Jonas: Because it depends on finding the right person. When it works, it is very effective, like my negotiation. But it is not always available. People are busy. And it can be generic. So I cannot assume it will solve my team lead question. But it can help.
Anna: Fourth, perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10.
Jonas: For career situation, like leadership path, maybe 3. For technical growth, it is like 8. But you ask for my situation career-wise, so 3.
Anna: What makes it 3, not zero?
Jonas: Because it can still help with structured planning, CV, phrasing, brainstorming lists. But I avoid it mostly, so the impact is limited.
Anna: Thank you. Now, I want to describe a hypothetical hybrid model. Imagine a career support platform where AI helps you prepare, like clarifying goals, drafting questions, structuring options, and then you have sessions with a human mentor for deeper discussion and decisions. After the session, AI helps with follow-up plans and reminders. What is your reaction?
Jonas: That sounds, um, actually reasonable. Because AI as preparation and follow-up is less risky. The human part is where trust and emotional depth happens. But the key is privacy and boundaries. Like, what data does the AI see. If it sees my full story, I am not comfortable. If I can control what I input, maybe.
Anna: What would you need to trust such a hybrid model?
Jonas: Clear data boundaries. Like, ideally, AI runs locally or you have strong guarantees. And transparency. Also, I would want the human to be independent, not like sales. And I would want to choose what the AI stores. Like, delete button. And explainability, at least some. Like, why it suggests something.
Anna: And what would make it feel effective?
Jonas: If the human mentor is good and context-aware, and the AI helps reduce admin work. Like, I do not want to spend my mentor time writing lists. I want to talk. If AI can organize my thoughts, that is effective. Also, if it helps me do micro-experiments, like tasks to try leadership in small steps.
Anna: Do you have any concerns about a hybrid model?
Jonas: Yes. That it becomes worse of both. Like, AI collects data, human is limited. Or the human relies on AI too much and stops thinking. Or I get a generic plan again. Also, there is a risk of false confidence. If the AI writes a beautiful plan, I might think it is reality, but in a scale-up, reality changes weekly.
Anna: So you want adaptability.
Jonas: Yes. And also, I want creativity preserved. Like, leadership that still allows building things. If the hybrid model pushes me toward a pure manager role, I would reject it.
Anna: How would you define good leadership, in practice, that would still feel creative?
Jonas: Good question.I think good leadership in engineering can be creative if it is about shaping systems and people growth. Like, you design the environment. You mentor. You make decisions under uncertainty. That can be creative. But the fear is that it becomes bureaucracy, like just managing Jira tickets. So good leadership is not just meetings, but direction. Technical direction and also culture.
Anna: In your company, what does leadership look like right now?
Jonas: It is mixed. We have some leads who are like technical leaders. They still code, they do architecture, they mentor, they push quality. And we have some who are, um, more like project managers. They coordinate, but they do not have technical depth. In a fintech, that can be dangerous, because decisions have security implications. So the good ones, they combine technical competence with communication.
Anna: Do you see a path to become that kind of lead?
Jonas: Maybe. But it is not clearly supported. That is why I am thinking a lot. Like, do I push internally to become Staff Engineer, which is more technical leadership, or do I try Team Lead but set boundaries, like I still code. Or do I leave to a company with a better defined ladder.
Anna:If you could ask one question to an ideal mentor, what would it be?
Jonas: I would ask, what does your week look like and do you still feel creative. And what did you sacrifice. Because I think every path has sacrifice.
Anna: That is very honest. Earlier you said you want friction, someone to challenge you. Do you think AI could be designed to challenge you instead of confirming?
Jonas: In theory, yes. Like, if it is instructed to argue both sides, or to ask hard questions. But I am not sure I would believe it. Because it is still a system. With a human, the challenge feels more real. Like, they see you and they push you. AI pushing me feels like text.
Anna: So the relational element matters.
Jonas: Yes. And accountability. If I tell Markus, I will do this, next time he asks. AI can remind me, but it is not the same social pressure.
Anna: Do you ever feel judged by humans, and does that reduce trust?
Jonas: Yes. That is another thing. If a mentor is judgemental, I shut down. Like, if they say, why are you afraid, just do it. Then trust drops. Markus was not like that. He was calm.
Anna: And with AI, do you feel judged?
Jonas: No, but I feel observed. Hahaha. Like, the system is watching. Not emotionally, but data-wise.
Anna: That is a good distinction.
Jonas: Yeah.
9) Closing

Anna: We are near the end. Is there anything you expected me to ask but I did not?
Jonas: Maybe, um, about how I choose tools. Like, I am not anti-AI. I like it for work. But for career, I want to keep it human. At least for now. And I think many engineers are like that. We use AI as productivity, but not for life decisions.
Anna: That is very helpful. If you had one recommendation for someone building career AI tools, what would it be?
Jonas: Respect privacy by design. Not as marketing. And make it less agreeable. Make it challenge you, like a good mentor. And be honest about limitations. If it is uncertain, say it.
Anna: Thank you. Last check, are you still comfortable with the recording and use for anonymized research?
Jonas: Yes.
Anna: Great. Thanks Jonas. I will stop the recording now.
Jonas: Okay. Bye.
Anna: Bye.


Alina
1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Alina, can you hear me well?
Alina: Yes, hi Anna. I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Anna: Yes, perfectly. Thanks for joining. Before we start, I want to confirm consent. Do I have your permission to record this interview? The recording is only for transcription, everything will be anonymised, and you can skip any question.
Alina: Yes, you can record. That is okay.
Anna: Thank you. And just to check, are there any topics you would prefer not to discuss today?
Alina: Eehm. Maybe, like, very specific details about my employer, like the name or internal processes. But in general, we can talk about the work.
Anna: Absolutely. We will keep it at a general level, and if something feels too specific, just say stop or we can rephrase. Also, if I ask something and you are not comfortable, you can pass.
Alina: Okay, yes.
Anna: Great. One more thing, because we will talk about AI tools and coaching, I might ask you to give quick ratings from 0 to 10 at some point. It is not a test, just a way to structure the discussion.
Alina: Okay. Sounds fine.
Anna: Perfect. Then we can start. Can you briefly introduce yourself, just in terms of your current situation?
Alina: Sure.
2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now, or recently faced?
Alina: Um, so I am 29, I live in Frankfurt, I moved here from Ukraine four and a half years ago. I work in a bank, in a compliance team. And my situation is, like, stable. I have a stable contract, stable life, I have my apartment, I have friends here. But I feel, eehm, bored. Like, it is not crisis, it is not burnout. It is more like, I wake up and I know exactly what I will do. And it is fine, but it is not, how to say, meaningful. So my career question is how to pivot from compliance into ESG or sustainability reporting, maybe ESG risk, something like that. I am trying to understand how realistic it is, and what steps actually make sense in Germany.
Anna: When you say bored, what does that look like in your day-to-day? Like, what is missing?
Alina: It is difficult because the job is important, like compliance is important, but it feels very, um, procedural. Like, checklists, documentation, approvals. A lot of writing memos, following internal policies, and being very careful. And I like careful. I studied law originally, so I am okay with details. But I feel disconnected from impact. It is more about preventing risk for the bank, which is logical, but it is not like building something or contributing to, I do not know, society. It is a bit dramatic, but you asked what is missing. It is meaning and growth. Growth also because compliance can be a bit, how to say, narrow. You can become senior, you can become team lead, but the tasks stay similar.
Anna: What is your current role, like broadly? What do you actually do in the compliance team?
Alina: I work in a team that supports business lines, like corporate clients and sometimes investment products, but not trading. We do compliance advisory. So we review certain cases, we answer questions from stakeholders, we check if communications are okay, we support audits, we coordinate with risk and legal. A big part is documentation. Like, everything must be documented, why we approved something, what was the basis. There are internal controls, four-eyes principle, sometimes escalations. And there is always the idea that regulators can ask later. So you need to be able to show the trail.
Anna: What is the biggest career decision you made in the last 6 to 12 months?
Alina: Hahaha. The biggest one is that I decided to stay in my bank for now instead of switching to another bank or consulting. Because I had this moment where I thought, okay, maybe the boredom is because I am in the wrong company, not the wrong field. So I interviewed a bit, like not a lot, but I talked to recruiters and did two interviews for a compliance role in another institution. And then I realised it is the same, just different logo. So I decided, okay, if I want change, it needs to be a direction change, not just a company change.
Anna: What made that decision difficult?
Alina: Eehm, security. Germany is expensive, Frankfurt also. And I am not German, so stability matters. Also my residency situation is stable now, but I still think about it. Like, I have a residence permit tied to employment. I am on a skilled worker path, and I can apply for permanent residency soon, but I need stable employment and language level. So part of the decision is, do not do something too risky until I have that. And also the bank environment, it is very conservative. If you move around too much, people ask questions, like, why? And I am not sure if this is in my head, but yeah.
Anna: Can you share a bit more about your move to Germany and the residency context, as much as you feel comfortable?
Alina: Sure. I moved in 2021. It was, eehm, partly personal, partly professional. I had a partner then, in Germany. It did not work out long term, but the move was already done. Also I wanted a more international career, and in Ukraine I studied law, but the job market in law is, how to say, very local. Germany felt like a place where I could restart. I first came with a job seeker plan, but then I got an offer in a financial services company, not my current bank. And later I moved to the bank, because Frankfurt has a lot of these roles and I wanted to be closer to regulation and more structured career path.
Anna: What is your German level now?
Alina: Officially B2, but in reality, like, I can work in English in my team. Our internal documents are German, but many meetings are English. However, to move internally, sometimes they want German. And in compliance, German is important because you write policies, you communicate with local stakeholders. So I use German daily, but I still feel insecure. Like, I can do it, but it costs energy.
Anna: And what triggered your interest in ESG or sustainability reporting specifically?
Alina: There was one moment, actually. We had an internal project about new regulatory expectations, and one of the topics was ESG risk integration. Not the deep technical part, but the fact that regulators expect banks to consider climate risk, transition risk, reputational risk. And there was a presentation, and I remember thinking, finally, something that connects regulation with real world outcomes. Like, if a bank finances something, it matters. And also, I started reading more about EU regulation, like CSRD, EU taxonomy, SFDR. And it felt like a field that is new enough that I can enter, but still serious, still compliance-adjacent. It is not like I want to become, I do not know, a marketing person. It is still structured, but with more meaning.
Anna: Can you tell me about one specific episode at work where you felt bored or disconnected?
Alina: Yes. It was, um, a case where we had to review a client communication. It was a standard letter, like informing about fee changes. And we went back and forth for days because of wording. Like, one sentence about risks had to be in a specific order, and we had to ensure the German was perfect. And I get why. But after the third iteration, I thought, this is my life? And it was not intellectually challenging, it was just cautious. And then I compared it with the ESG topics where there are open questions, like how to interpret requirements, how to build reporting processes, how to coordinate data across departments. That felt more like building.
Anna: What have you tried already to move toward ESG or sustainability reporting?
Alina: A few things. I did a short online course, like a certificate, not university, more like a professional training about CSRD basics and sustainability reporting. I also joined a couple of webinars from Big4, because they do a lot in this area. And I started networking a bit on LinkedIn, like following ESG professionals, reading posts, and I had two informational calls with people. One was in sustainability consulting, one was in a bank ESG risk function. And internally, I asked HR about internal mobility, like what options exist. But the internal move is tricky because ESG roles are limited and sometimes they prefer people already in risk management, or they want German C1, or they want someone who already worked with data and reporting.
Anna: What feels like the biggest friction right now in the pivot?
Alina: Credibility. Like, how do I translate my compliance skills into ESG narrative? I can say I know regulation, I can work with stakeholders, I can document. But ESG reporting also needs understanding of metrics, data, frameworks. And I do not have real project examples yet. So I feel like, eehm, I am in this loop where you need experience to get experience. And also, politics. In the bank, if you want to move, your manager has to support you. And my manager is nice, but of course, they do not want to lose a trained person. So I feel I need to be careful how I communicate.
Anna: What constraints do you have outside of work? Like personal constraints that affect your options.
Alina: I cannot take a big pay cut. I support my family sometimes. Not like full support, but I help. Also, I do not want to move to another city now. Frankfurt is my base, I built my life. And I need time for German. Also, I am a bit tired of instability. When I moved, it was a lot of change. Now I want growth, but not chaos. I mean, no wait, let me rephrase. I want change, but in a controlled way.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Alina: Mostly friends. I have a friend who is also in financial services, and we talk. I also talk to my sister, but she is not in Germany, so she supports emotionally. And online resources, like reading, LinkedIn. And then AI tools, I use them for drafting and understanding texts. But for career decisions, I still prefer humans. Because there is, um, fear. Like, if I say wrong thing, or if I make wrong move, it affects my residency, my stability. So I want a human reflection.
Anna: What has actually helped, and what felt unhelpful?
Alina: Helpful is when someone challenges me a bit, but realistically. Like, my friend says, okay, you say you want ESG, but what exactly? In a bank it can be different. And she asked me to list roles: ESG compliance, sustainability reporting, ESG risk. That helped. Unhelpful is generic motivation, like follow your passion. Because passion does not pay rent. Also, some online advice is very US-centric, like just network and you will get a job. In Germany, networking is helpful but it is not magic. And also, I noticed that many career coaches speak very generally, they do not understand regulated environments.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed most in the last months?
Alina: A roadmap. Like, steps. Not only emotional reassurance. Steps like, what skills are missing, how to get them, which internal stakeholders to speak to, how to present my story. And also confidence. Because I doubt if I am, how to say, allowed to pivot. Like, I am an immigrant, I already changed field once, from law to compliance. And now I want another change. So I need both structure and emotional grounding.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust

Anna: You mentioned you tried a coach once. Can you tell me about that experience? How did you find the coach?
Alina: Yes. It was last year, like maybe spring. I found her through a recommendation from a friend in Frankfurt. She is a career coach, but also she had worked in HR in a financial institution before. That sounded good. We had, I think, three sessions. First was like getting to know me, second and third were more about my situation.
Anna: What made you decide to try coaching at that point?
Alina: I was feeling stuck. Like, I was complaining to friends, and I realised they cannot solve it. And I was also feeling anxious, like, is my boredom ungrateful? Because the job is stable. So I wanted a neutral person. Also, in Ukraine, coaching is becoming popular, and I thought, okay, maybe it can help.
Anna: What were the sessions like, practically? Like Zoom, in person, what did you do?
Alina: It was Zoom. She sent me a short questionnaire before, like values, goals. In the session, she asked many questions. It was very, um, reflective. Like, what do you want, what is your ideal day, what energises you. She was warm. She listened. She repeated back things. There was a lot of space for emotions. I cried once. Not like dramatic, but I was overwhelmed.
Anna: What created trust for you in that coaching experience?
Alina: Confidentiality. She explained that everything stays between us, and she had a professional vibe. Like, she did not push me to buy ten sessions. She was also empathetic, but not pity. She validated that boredom can be a sign that you outgrow a role. Also, she understood the bank culture a bit. Not deeply, but enough to know that compliance is sensitive and that internal moves are political. That made me feel she is not naive.
Anna: Were there any moments where you felt, okay, I can really open up?
Alina: Yes. In the second session, I told her about my fear of being seen as unstable. Like, in Germany, I sometimes feel I have to be perfect. Like, be grateful, be stable, do not complain. And she said something like, it is okay to want more, and it does not mean you are ungrateful. And she also asked about my identity, like, who are you beyond your job. That was emotional, but it felt safe.
Anna: And what did you hope to get from coaching, specifically?
Alina: Action. Like, I wanted to leave with a plan. Maybe not full plan, but at least clear steps. Like, which roles to target, how to position myself, what courses matter, how to approach internal stakeholders. I expected some of that because she had HR background.
Anna: Did you get that?
Alina: Not really.I got emotional relief. I felt lighter. I felt less alone. And I had some clarity on values, like I care about impact and learning. But when it came to market steps, it was vague. She said, explore, talk to people, update your LinkedIn. But I was like, okay, how? Who? Where? What is a realistic ESG entry role? Should I do a certificate like GRI? Should I learn data? Should I go to consulting? She did not have concrete answers. And she also did not give frameworks, like a networking map. It was more, trust the process.
Anna: So in your experience, it was trusted but not effective in the way you needed?
Alina: Yes, exactly. I trusted her as a person. I felt safe. But effectiveness, for my situation, was limited. Because my problem is partly emotional, but also very practical, like German job market, regulatory field, internal politics.
Anna: What would have made it more effective?
Alina: Industry-specific competence. Like, if she knew ESG roles in banks, or at least knew how to research them with me. Also structure. Like, give me homework that is not only journaling, but tasks like identify ten target roles, identify five people to talk to, draft a pivot story, revise CV for ESG, do interview practice. And also maybe accountability, like check progress.
Anna: Was there anything that reduced trust in that coaching, even if you felt safe overall?
Alina: Eehm, not reduced trust, but I noticed that sometimes she used very confident statements without evidence, like, you will find something if you follow your values. And I was like, maybe, but the market is hard. So I started to separate emotional truth from market truth. But I did not think she had bad intentions.
Anna: If you think about trust drivers for a human coach in general, what are the main ones for you?
Alina: Confidentiality, like clear boundaries. Empathy, but professional. Competence in my context, like understanding regulated environments, immigration context, German market. Structure, like a process, not random talking. And feeling seen, like the coach remembers details and connects patterns. Also realism. Like, do not just motivate me, but tell me what is hard and how to approach it.
Anna: And what are your indicators that human coaching is effective?
Alina: Clarity and steps. Like, I leave with decisions. Also, real market signals, like interviews or feedback from people in the field. And confidence, but grounded confidence, not just hype. Also reduced anxiety, because I feel in control.
5) AI tools: experience and trust

Anna: You also mentioned you use AI tools. Can you tell me what you use them for and how often?
Alina: I use AI almost daily, but not always. Mostly for drafting German texts. Like emails to stakeholders, summaries, sometimes policy wording, but I am careful. Also for understanding regulations, like if I read a long document and I need to understand the structure, definitions, or differences between terms. I use it like a study buddy.
Anna: Which kind of tool is it? Like a chatbot interface?
Alina: Yes, like a conversational tool. I do not want to say the brand, but it is basically a chatbot. Sometimes I also use internal tools, like translation software, but the AI chat is the main one.
Anna: What makes you cautious, you mentioned confidentiality?
Alina: Yes. Banking compliance is very sensitive. You cannot put client info, you cannot put internal cases. Even internal policies, sometimes you should not share externally. So I never paste confidential details. I anonymise. I write like, imagine a bank has scenario X, what is the general principle. Or I ask it to improve German style without context.
Anna: Can you give a concrete example of how you use it for German drafting?
Alina: Sure. For example, I need to write an email in German to a business stakeholder about a compliance requirement. My German is okay, but corporate German is, how to say, heavy. Like, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, but also not too formal, and you need this passive voice, and you need to sound firm but polite. So I write a draft in simple German, then I ask the AI to rewrite in professional corporate German tone. It gives me options. I then adjust because sometimes it is too much, too long, too fluffy. But it helps.
Anna: And for regulations, what kind of questions?
Alina: Like, explain the difference between two concepts. Or summarise a regulatory text into bullet points. Or give me a structure for a memo. Sometimes I ask, what are typical compliance controls for topic X. Not specific to my bank, but general. Or I ask it to translate a paragraph and explain terms.
Anna: Can you describe one moment where AI helped a lot?
Alina: Yes. There was a time we had to write a short internal note about a regulatory update. The source was in German, but the audience was mixed, some colleagues prefer English. I needed to summarise quickly. I asked AI to help me structure the memo: background, key changes, impact, next steps. It gave a clean structure. Then I filled in with my content. It saved time. Also, it helped me find the right German phrases, like angemessen, unverzüglich, solche words that appear often.
Anna: And one moment where AI failed or felt risky?
Alina: It failed when I asked about interpretation of a regulation. Like, I asked about a specific requirement, and it answered very confidently, like, you must do X. And I thought, okay, but is this true? I checked the source, and it was more nuanced. It was not exactly wrong, but it oversimplified. And in compliance, oversimplification is dangerous. Also, hallucination risk. Sometimes it invents an article number or a reference. And if you trust it, you can make mistakes.
Anna: How did that affect your trust?
Alina: It made me trust it conditionally. Like, I trust it for language and structure, but not for final interpretation. I always verify. So it can be effective, but not fully trusted.
Anna: If you think about trust drivers for AI tools, what are they for you?
Alina: Usefulness, like it actually helps. Consistency. If it gives good drafts. Also transparency about limitations. I like when it says, check sources. But sometimes it does not. And privacy. Like, I do not want my data stored. So I keep it generic. And accuracy, especially with regulatory topics.
Anna: And effectiveness indicators for AI in your situation?
Alina: Speed. Clarity. Better language. Better structure. Less mental load. It helps me operate in German corporate environment. It also reduces anxiety because I feel I can draft something and not sound stupid. But effectiveness is limited for deep career decisions, because it does not know my full context, and I do not want to share sensitive details.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: I want to compare human coaching and AI via specific tasks. I will name a few typical career support tasks, and you tell me which one you would prefer and why. Is that okay?
Alina: Yes.
Anna: First task: clarifying options. Like, what roles exist, what pathways exist.
Alina: AI is good for brainstorming options. Like, list roles in ESG in banking, list skills. It can give a broad map. But I would prefer a human to refine it for Germany and for my profile. Because AI can list everything, but it does not tell you what is realistic. And also, a human can ask me questions to narrow.
Anna: Second task: deciding between options. Like, choosing whether to pivot now or later, internal move or external.
Alina: Human. Because it involves risk, emotions, and also my residency context. I do not want to put that in AI. And a human can sense fear, and also challenge me. AI can be too neutral, like here are pros and cons, but it does not help me commit.
Anna: Third task: planning concrete steps. Like a 3-month plan or 6-month plan.
Alina: This is interesting. AI can help structure a plan, like a template. But a human is better for accountability and realism. So maybe hybrid. Like AI drafts the plan, human reviews and adjusts, and then human holds me accountable.
Anna: Fourth task: CV positioning and LinkedIn profile, specifically for an ESG pivot.
Alina: AI is helpful for wording, especially in German. Like translating my compliance experience into sustainability language. But again, a human with market knowledge is needed to tell me what recruiters want, what keywords matter, what achievements to highlight. So also hybrid.
Anna: Fifth task: networking strategy. Like who to talk to, how to approach.
Alina: Human, because of nuance. In Germany, networking is not like, hey, can I pick your brain. It can feel awkward. A human can help with scripts and with cultural tone. AI can write a message, but it might sound unnatural or too American. Though you can prompt it, but still.
Anna: Sixth task: interview practice.
Alina: Human. Because you need feedback on how you come across. AI can simulate questions, but it cannot fully read me. Also, in compliance and ESG, there is a lot of nuance, and a human can see if I am convincing.
Anna: Seventh task: emotional support, like anxiety, self-doubt.
Alina: Human. Always. AI feels, um, empty for that. It can say supportive things, but it is not the same as feeling seen.
Anna: And what about understanding regulations for a new field like CSRD or taxonomy?
Alina: AI as a starting point, but verified. And also human, like training or expert, because you need correct interpretation. For learning, AI is good. For decision-making, no.
7) Trust–effectiveness link
Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human coaching, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Alina: Trust is like the gate. If I do not trust the coach, I will not share the real constraints. Like my fear about residency, or my financial obligations, or my insecurity about German. And then the coach can only give generic advice. So trust enables depth. And depth makes it effective. Also, if I trust the coach, I will actually do the homework. If I think the coach is not competent, I will ignore it.
Anna: Can you connect that to your coaching episode? How did trust and effectiveness interact there?
Alina: Yes. I trusted her, so I shared emotions and fears. That was effective for emotional relief. But because she lacked market competence, the coaching was not effective for steps. So trust alone was not enough. It was trusted but not effective for the practical part. I would say, trust enabled the emotional work, but effectiveness for career outcomes needed competence and structure.
Anna: And for AI tools, how does trust affect effectiveness?
Alina: I use AI even when I do not fully trust it. Like, I know it can be wrong, but it is still effective for drafting. So that is, how you said, effective but not fully trusted. I trust it as a tool, not as an authority. I trust it to generate text options, not to decide. And because trust is partial, I always verify. That verification step reduces risk but also takes time. So the effectiveness is limited by trust, but not zero.
Anna: So in your words, trust and effectiveness are separable?
Alina: Yes. For humans, trust is more connected because if you do not trust, you do not open up, and then nothing works. For AI, you can use it pragmatically without trust, because it is like a calculator, but with words. But you still need some trust to rely on it without checking.
Anna: If you think about a situation where you would not use AI because trust is too low, what would that be?
Alina: Anything confidential. Like a real compliance case with client details. Or something that could be used against me. Like discussing internal politics or naming people. I do not want that anywhere. So for sensitive discussions, I prefer human, because confidentiality is clearer. Though even with humans, you need to trust them.
Anna: And what about effectiveness. What would make you say, this support was effective?
Alina: If I make progress. Like I have a clear target role, I take steps, I get interviews, I build credibility. Or even if I do not get interviews yet, I have real market feedback from informational calls. And I feel less anxious because I know what I am doing.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction

Anna: I want to ask you about a hybrid model. Imagine a career support service where AI helps you prepare, like clarify options, draft documents, track steps, and then a human expert steps in for sensitive discussions, decisions, and accountability. What is your reaction?
Alina: That sounds ideal, actually. Because AI can do the heavy lifting for drafts and structure. And humans can do the judgment and emotional part. Also it reduces cost maybe, because you do not need many human sessions for basic things. But the key is, the human must be competent in my domain. Like, an ESG person or someone who knows banking and Germany.
Anna: What would make you trust such a hybrid model?
Alina: Clear boundaries. Like, what data goes to AI, what stays private. Maybe an option to keep everything local, but that is technical. Also transparency: who are the human experts, what is their background. And a process. Like, step 1 AI intake, step 2 human session, step 3 AI follow-up tasks, step 4 check-in. That would make me feel safe. And also confidentiality policies, like GDPR, data handling. In Germany, people care.
Anna: What would make you not trust it?
Alina: If it feels like marketing. Like, we have AI and it will change your life. Or if the human is too generic. Or if the AI gives advice that feels wrong but confident. And if they push me to share too much personal data.
Anna: What tasks would you want AI to lead, and what tasks would you want the human to lead?
Alina: AI leads drafting, translation, structuring, brainstorming. Human leads decisions, career narrative, networking strategy with cultural nuance, interview practice, and emotional support. Also, like, helping me interpret market signals. AI can list roles, but human can say, for you, this role is realistic if you do X.
Anna: Let us do the micro-poll ratings now. I will ask four ratings from 0 to 10, and I would like you to explain each briefly. First, your current trust in human career coaches, in general, for your situation. 0 is no trust, 10 is full trust.
Alina: I would say 7.
Anna: Why 7?
Alina: Because humans can be empathetic and confidential, and they can adapt. But I do not fully trust because many coaches are not competent in my niche. So I trust humans as humans, but I need to check their expertise.
Anna: Second, your trust in AI tools for your career-related needs. 0 to 10.
Alina: Maybe 5.
Anna: Why 5?
Alina: Because I trust it for drafting and structure, but not for deep advice. Also confidentiality concerns. And accuracy issues. So it is useful, but trust is limited.
Anna: Third, perceived effectiveness of human coaching for your situation. 0 to 10.
Alina: For my situation, I would say 4.
Anna: What makes it 4?
Alina: My experience was emotionally helpful, but not actionable. So effectiveness for my actual goal, pivot to ESG, was low. Maybe if I find the right coach, it can be higher. But based on what I saw, it is not very effective.
Anna: Fourth, perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation.
Alina: That is higher. I would say 7.
Anna: Why 7?
Alina: Because it helps me daily with German, with structuring, with learning. It makes me more productive and confident in communication. It does not solve my career pivot alone, but it supports me in practical tasks.
Anna: Interesting. So you have higher effectiveness for AI than for the human coaching you experienced, but lower trust.
Alina: Yes, exactly. That is the paradox.
Anna: If you imagine the ideal support for your ESG pivot, what would it look like in, say, three months?
Alina: I would have a clear target role. Like, I decide, okay, I aim for sustainability reporting under CSRD in a bank, or ESG risk. And I have a plan: courses, internal project involvement, maybe a small internal task force, networking calls. I would also have my CV updated with an ESG narrative. And maybe I would have at least one interview or at least two strong informational calls that lead to opportunities. And I would feel less like, I am dreaming, and more like, I am executing.
Anna: What would be the first step you want help with right now?
Alina: Narrowing the target. Because ESG is broad. I need help to choose the path that matches my compliance background. And then I need help to create credibility, like projects or certifications. And also, German. I know it is not sexy, but it matters.
Anna: When you think about hybrid, would you want the human to be a coach, like reflective, or more like a mentor, like insider?
Alina: More like insider. I think coaching style is nice, but I already have self-awareness. I need someone who knows the field, who can say, in Frankfurt, in banks, this is how ESG roles look, these are the hiring channels, these are the skills. Also, someone who can tell me honestly if my story makes sense.
Anna: And how should AI be positioned in that model, so that you are comfortable?
Alina: As assistant, not as authority. Like, it helps you prepare for the human session, it helps you draft, it tracks tasks. But it should not pretend it knows better than the human. Also it should have clear disclaimers, like verify sources, but in a calm way. And you should be able to choose what you share.
9) Closing

Anna: We are coming to the end. Is there anything important about your experience with human coaching or AI tools for career support that we did not cover, that you think matters?
Alina: Maybe one thing. In regulated environments, trust is already part of the culture. Like, we are trained to be cautious. So when people say, just use AI, it is not that simple. It is not only fear, it is professional responsibility. So for me, AI is helpful, but I always have this compliance brain saying, check, verify, do not share. And with humans, trust is also not automatic. You need someone who understands that mindset, otherwise they think you are just anxious.
Anna: That is very helpful. If you could give one advice to a designer of a career support service for people like you, what would it be?
Alina: Make it specific. Like, do not say career coaching for everyone. Make pathways for regulated professions, for immigrants, for Germany-specific context. And combine practical steps with emotional support. Because we are not robots. Even in compliance, there is emotion. We just hide it. 
Anna: Thank you. Last check, do you have any questions for me about the research or the interview?
Alina: Not really. I am curious what you find. But no questions now.
Anna: Great. Thanks again for your time and for being open. I will stop the recording now.
Alina: Thank you, Anna. Bye.
Anna: Bye.


Pierre  
1. Opening and consent
Anna: Hi Pierre, can you hear me well?
Pierre: Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Anna: Yes, perfectly. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything will be anonymised, and you can skip any question.
Pierre: Yes, you can record. That is fine.
Anna: Great, thank you. And just to check, are there any topics you prefer not to discuss today?
Pierre: Um, no, I think it is okay. Maybe no very specific company secrets, like supplier names, but career stuff is fine.
Anna: Of course. We will keep it at a general level. Also, if at any point you want to pause, just tell me.
Pierre: Okay.
Anna: Cool. Then we can start with a bit of context about you and your current situation.
2. Participant context and career situation
Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now?
Pierre: Eehm, so I am Pierre, I am 27. I am from France, from Lyon originally, and I moved to Stuttgart two years ago. I did a Master in Industrial Design. After that I worked one year in France, in a small studio, and then I got this job in Germany in a hardware company. It is like, not a startup, it is more established. Mid size but very German in the way it works. I am in product design, but also I coordinate with suppliers. So my role is half craft, half, like, coordination and industrialisation things.
Anna: When you say hardware company, what kind of products are you working on?
Pierre: We do components for mobility and also some industrial devices. Not full cars, but parts that go into systems. For example, housings, interface elements, sometimes a complete device like a charging module. It is very, how to say, manufacturing heavy. Lots of tolerances, testing, certifications, and supplier chain.
Anna: And what is the career dilemma you are facing at the moment?
Pierre: The big dilemma is, do I stay in this corporate style environment and grow slowly, or do I switch to a startup. And if I switch, what startup, what role. Like should I be product designer in a startup, or should I go more into product management, or like design engineering. And also I have this fear, like, if I go to a startup, it looks cool now, but later, does it look serious. Does it give credibility for, like, a long career, especially in Germany where people like stability.
Anna: What has made this dilemma urgent for you now, as opposed to one year ago?
Pierre: Um, good question. I think it is the slowness. I enjoy the craft and the design work, like sketching, CAD, making prototypes, even small details like surface finish, textures, how a knob feels. I love this. But the process is very slow. So I feel blocked. And then I see friends in startups who ship things faster, they have more ownership. And I also feel my learning is not as fast now as I want.
Anna: Can you give me a concrete example of the slowness, like a story that really shows it?
Pierre: Yes. I have one story that is very typical. We had a new revision of a housing for a module. It was not a huge change, it was like a small change for a connector position, but it impacts the injection mold. So we had to go through internal approvals, then purchasing, then quality, then the supplier. The supplier says, okay, change request, we need a new insert. Then purchasing wants three quotes. Then quality wants a risk assessment. Then there is a meeting, and in the meeting everyone says the same thing, but nobody decides.
Anna: Mm.
Pierre: So it took, I think, maybe ten weeks just to approve a change that in a smaller environment would be, like, okay, we do it, we adjust, we test. And the funniest part is, at the end, we still had a mistake because the requirements document was not updated properly. So we lost ten weeks and still had an issue. And I remember sitting there like, why am I spending my time on chasing signatures.
Anna: What did that do to your motivation?
Pierre: It makes me feel, um, like I am not a designer but a process manager. And I do not hate it, I understand it is needed in hardware, because you cannot just change like in software. But the amount of bureaucracy is too much. And also Stuttgart is very automotive culture. Like everything is planned, conservative, risk avoidance. Sometimes it is good, but it can kill creativity.
Anna: Where do you feel you are strongest right now in your role?
Pierre: I think I am strong in concept development and also in translating between design and engineering. Like I can talk to engineers, I can understand constraints, and then still keep a design intent. And with suppliers, I can communicate, like, what is the key parameter, what is the must-have, what can be flexible. So I am not only aesthetic.
Anna: And what feels hardest?
Pierre: The politics and the waiting. And also, eehm, the feeling that my career path is not clear. Like in Germany, there is a clear ladder for engineers sometimes. For designers in hardware, it is less clear. You can become senior designer, but then what. And because I am not German, I also feel I need to prove credibility.
Anna: How is your German now?
Pierre: It is okay for work, like B1, maybe low B2. I can do meetings, but sometimes I miss nuance. When people speak Swabian, forget it. I can do small talk, but when it is conflict or negotiation, English is easier for me. But in this region, German is important, especially in supplier discussions.
Anna: You mentioned status and credibility. Can you say more about what status means for you in this decision?
Pierre: Um, yes. It is a bit stupid maybe, but, like, the name of the company on your CV. In France also, but in Germany maybe more, people look at it. If you are in a known industrial company, it signals stability. If you are in a startup, people ask, is it serious, did you really do something, or is it chaos.
Anna: Is that coming from your own view, or from other people, like family, peers, LinkedIn?
Pierre: All of it. My family, they are like, you moved to Germany, good job, stable, good salary, why you want to risk. And then on LinkedIn, you see people move to startups and it looks modern, but you also see people come back and say, it failed. And I am like, if I move now, in two years, will I be able to come back to corporate if I want. Or will they see me as unstable.
Anna: What would success look like for you, if things go well?
Pierre: Success is, I am doing meaningful product work, shipping real things, not just PowerPoints. And I have a clear story. Like, I can explain why I did this path. And I feel my skills grow. Also, I want to be in a place where decisions are made faster, but still with quality. And maybe long term, I could lead a design team, or be a product lead for hardware, like owning a product line.
Anna: What is the biggest career decision you have made in the last six to twelve months?
Pierre: The biggest decision was, I started actively exploring startups. Not only thinking, but actually doing something. I joined events in Stuttgart, I talked to people, I started a side project to update my portfolio. And I also had a conversation internally about rotation, like maybe moving to a more innovation focused team. But that one, hmm, it did not really move.
Anna: What made it difficult to decide?
Pierre: Uncertainty. Like, what is the right startup, what is the right role. Also salary risk. Stuttgart is expensive. And visas are not an issue because I am EU, but still, stability matters. And then fear of making a wrong move and losing credibility.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed while making that decision?
Pierre: I needed someone who understands design careers in hardware, and understands Germany. And someone who can be honest, like tell me, Pierre, your portfolio is good but you need this, or your story is weak here. I needed structure, like steps, not only motivation.
3. Career support in general
Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Pierre: Um, I talk with friends, mostly designers. Some are in Berlin, some in Munich, some in Paris. I also talk with one colleague at work, but carefully, because you do not want to look like you want to leave. I also look at online resources, like articles, videos, and sometimes I use AI tools for certain tasks. Not really for self reflection, more for brainstorming.
Anna: What has actually helped you in the past, and what felt unhelpful?
Pierre: Helpful is when people give specific feedback. Like, not, follow your passion, but, your portfolio needs more manufacturing constraints, show how you work with suppliers, show DFM. Also helpful is when someone challenges your assumptions. Unhelpful is general advice, like, just apply everywhere, or just go to Berlin, like it is simple. And also unhelpful is when people project their own fear. Like family says, startup is dangerous, but they do not know the ecosystem.
Anna: In Stuttgart specifically, do you feel there are support structures or networks that matter?
Pierre: Yes, there are meetups, but it is different from Berlin. Stuttgart has this manufacturing gravity, like automotive suppliers, hardware culture. There are accelerators, there are innovation hubs, but it is still connected to big companies. Even startups often work with corporates. So the culture is more B2B, more industrial. That affects the kind of roles.
Anna: How do you approach networking there?
Pierre: Slowly. In France I am more direct. Here, people want to know you over time. I go to events, I talk, but I also follow up on LinkedIn, like, danke for the conversation, and then maybe coffee. It is slow but it works.
Anna: Any professional services, like formal career coaching, university career center, anything like that?
Pierre: I did not do paid career coaching. But I had mentoring through an accelerator program, like a program connected to innovation, where they match mentors. That was the closest to coaching, and it was very helpful.
Anna: We will go into that. Before that, one more question. When you think about career support, what do you wish existed, like an ideal support?
Pierre: Something that combines honest human feedback with structured tools. Like, you can prepare with tools, gather options, but then a human helps you with nuance, and with the story. And also accountability, because I procrastinate sometimes.
Anna: Okay. Let us move into your mentoring experience.
4. Human coaching: experience and trust 
Anna: Tell me about the mentoring you had through the accelerator program. What was the situation and what did you work on?
Pierre: So, about one year ago, I joined an accelerator style program, not as a founder, more like as a participant in an innovation track. It was connected to hardware and mobility. They offered mentoring. I was matched with a mentor who had worked in product development, like design and product strategy, in Germany and also internationally. He was older, maybe in his 40s, and very direct.
Anna: How many sessions did you have?
Pierre: Three sessions over, like, two months. And some messages in between.
Anna: What made it work for you?
Pierre: The honesty. Like, first session, I showed my portfolio, and he said, eehm, your work is good, but your story is too safe. You show nice renders, but you do not show what you own. And he asked me, what do you want, like really. And I started with corporate polite answers, like, I want to grow, I want impact. And he interrupted and said, no, what do you want, specifically. And I was like, okay, I want to design products that ship, and I want to be in a faster environment. And he said, then your current narrative does not match.
Anna: That sounds quite confronting. How did you experience that?
Pierre: At first, I was defensive. I was like, who is he to judge. But then, I felt he was not attacking me, he was just precise. And he had credibility, because he knew the industry. He talked about supplier lead times, manufacturing gates, he understood. So I trusted him.
Anna: Can you recall a vivid moment, something he said that felt especially honest or helpful?
Pierre: Yes. There was a moment where I said, I want to go to a startup but I am afraid it looks bad later. And he said, you are mixing fear and strategy. He said, prestige is not a plan. And I was like, ouch. But he explained. He said, you need to define what skills you want, what story you want, and then choose environments that build it. Prestige will come from coherence, not from logos. He said something like, if you go to a small company and you can explain your impact, it is stronger than being a small person in a big logo.
Anna: What did that change for you after the session?
Pierre: I started to redesign my portfolio. Not redesign like visuals, but content. I added one case study that shows supplier coordination. Like, I show the iterations, the constraints, the decisions. I also started writing short explanations of trade offs. And I also changed how I talk about my role. Before I was like, industrial designer. Now I say, industrial designer in hardware with supplier coordination and production readiness.
Anna: Did you take any action beyond portfolio changes?
Pierre: Yes. He told me to have one informational interview per week with someone in a startup environment, but in hardware, not software. So I did that for maybe six weeks. And it helped. I talked to someone in an e-mobility startup, someone in a medical device startup, someone in a robotics company. And I learned, roles are very different.
Anna: What did you learn about roles that mattered to your decision?
Pierre: That startup product designer can mean many things. Sometimes it is mostly CAD and prototypes, very hands-on. Sometimes it is UX and interfaces, more digital. Sometimes it is a mix with product management. So I realized I need to be careful. I do not want to become only a graphic person. I want to stay close to physical product.
Anna: What were the main drivers of trust for you with this mentor?
Pierre: Competence, first. He understood my context, hardware, Germany. Second, honest feedback, like he did not just comfort me. Third, confidentiality. He made it clear he is not connected to my company, and what we talk stays there. Fourth, he saw me as a person. He asked about my move to Germany, language, family pressure. And also structure. He gave tasks, like do this by next time, and we review.
Anna: Was there anything that reduced trust at any point?
Pierre: Not really. Maybe sometimes he was too fast. Like he assumes you can just do things. But overall, trust was high.
Anna: Did you ever have an experience where you trusted someone, but it was not effective?
Pierre: Yes. A colleague at work, he is very kind, very supportive. He says, Pierre, you are talented, you should go for internal promotion. He listened, he cared, so I trust him emotionally. But it was not effective because his advice was like, wait, be patient, it will come. And maybe it is true in corporate, but it did not give me steps. It kept me in the same loop. So I trusted him, but it did not change anything.
Anna: That distinction is helpful. When you think of effectiveness for the mentoring, how would you define it? What were your indicators?
Pierre: Effectiveness is, after sessions, I had clearer targets. Like I could say, okay, I want hardware startup in mobility or medical, not just any startup. And I had concrete actions: update portfolio, do informational interviews, prepare a story. Also I felt more confidence because I had a plan. So effectiveness is clarity plus action plus confidence.
Anna: Did mentoring influence your actual decisions, like did you apply somewhere?
Pierre: I have not signed anything, but I did start applying. Like, I applied to two roles, and I got one first interview. It did not go further, but it was a good test. And I changed how I present myself, thanks to the mentor.
Anna: What happened in that interview, if you can share at a high level?
Pierre: It was a robotics startup. They asked, why you leave corporate. Before I would say, I want faster pace. Now I said, I want higher ownership and shorter feedback loops, and I have experience bringing design to production, which is valuable in hardware. And they reacted well. They said, okay, you understand constraints. So that was a result.
Anna: Sounds like the mentor influenced both your materials and your narrative.
Pierre: Yes.
5. AI tools: experience and trust 
Anna: Let us talk about AI tools. What have you used, and in what situations related to your career or work?
Pierre: I use AI mostly for ideation prompts and naming concepts. Like, if we have a new module and we want internal concept names, or if I am brainstorming themes for a design direction. Sometimes also for writing, like to clean up an email in English or German. But not so much for self reflection. Because I feel it flattens nuance.
Anna: Can you walk me through a concrete moment where AI helped you a lot?
Pierre: Yes. We had a workshop where we needed to propose three concept directions for a new device. It was like an industrial device that also has a user interface, like a small screen, buttons, indicator lights. And the brief was confusing. Many stakeholders, marketing, engineering, sales. Everyone wants different things.
Anna: That sounds familiar to me 
Pierre: Yes. So I used AI to generate, like, categories. I gave constraints: industrial environment, gloves, dust, need readability, and also brand values. And I asked, propose concept themes with adjectives and quick rationale. It gave me like, rugged clarity, calm precision, modular honesty, things like that. Some were generic, but some helped me create a structure. Then I took the best ones and made sketches. So it helped me go from chaos to a frame.
Anna: So it was more like a structuring and variation tool.
Pierre: Exactly. Speed and variation.
Anna: And naming concepts?
Pierre: Yes, naming is funny. We need internal names sometimes for prototypes. AI is good for that. Like you say, give me names inspired by Swabian engineering and simplicity, and it gives you lists. Some are ridiculous, but some work. And it saves time.
Anna: Can you think of a moment where AI did not help, or even made it worse?
Pierre: Yes. I tried to use it for career reflection once. I wrote a long prompt about my dilemma, corporate vs startup, fear of prestige, Stuttgart culture. And it responded with very generic advice, like, consider your values, make a pros and cons list, network, follow your passion. And I was like, yes, I know. It felt like a blog post. It did not catch the nuance, like the specific signaling in German hardware.
Anna: What nuance did you feel was missing?
Pierre: The cultural nuance. Like in Stuttgart, startups are often connected to corporates. So it is not like Berlin. Also the design nuance, like in hardware, you cannot just iterate weekly. And also personal nuance, like my identity as a French person here, language, credibility. AI makes it smooth, but too smooth.
Anna: How would you describe your trust in AI tools for these different tasks?
Pierre: I trust AI for speed and for brainstorming, like generating options. But I do not trust its taste. Like in design, taste matters. AI suggestions can be same-y, like average. And I do not trust it for high stakes decisions, because it does not know the real constraints, and it can be confidently wrong.
Anna: Do you have concerns about privacy or data when using AI?
Pierre: Yes, a bit. At work, we are careful. We do not put confidential details. For personal career, I also do not want to put too much personal detail. But my main issue is not privacy, it is quality and nuance.
Anna: Did you ever use AI for job applications, like CV wording?
Pierre: A little bit. I used it to rewrite bullet points, like make it more concise. That was helpful. But I had to correct, because it sometimes makes claims too strong. Like it says, led cross functional teams, and I am like, no, I collaborated, I did not lead.
Anna: That is an interesting trust boundary.
Pierre: Yes, it tends to exaggerate.
Anna: Can you think of an example where AI was effective for you, but you did not fully trust it?
Pierre: Yes. The naming example. We needed a name for a concept, internal only, but it mattered for the presentation because it frames perception. AI gave a name that actually worked, it fit the concept. We used it. It was effective. But I did not fully trust it because it felt shallow, like it did not understand the deeper design intent, it just combined words.
Anna: That fits the idea of effective but not fully trusted.
Pierre: Exactly.
Anna: And the opposite, trusted but not effective, you already mentioned your colleague.
Pierre: Yes.
6. Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks
Anna: I want to compare human mentoring and AI tools through specific tasks. I will name a task, and you tell me what you would prefer and why. First task: clarifying career options. Like, what roles, what industries, what paths.
Pierre: For clarifying options, I would start with AI, because it is fast. Like, give me a map of roles in hardware startups, differences between industrial designer, mechanical design engineer, product manager, design strategist, whatever. It can give a good first overview. But then, I would want a human to validate and contextualize. Because AI can list roles, but it cannot tell you how it really looks in Stuttgart, or in a specific company.
Anna: Second task: making a decision, like corporate vs startup.
Pierre: Human. Because that is not only information, it is identity and fear. A human can challenge you, and also read between lines. AI cannot see when I am rationalizing. A mentor can say, you are using prestige as an excuse, or you are avoiding risk. AI is polite, it does not confront you in the same way.
Anna: Third task: building a concrete plan for the next six weeks.
Pierre: Hmm. Hybrid. AI can help structure, like a checklist: update portfolio, target list, networking, interviews, timeline. But a human can prioritise. Like, Pierre, stop perfecting visuals, focus on story. And a human can hold you accountable.
Anna: Fourth task: rewriting your CV and cover letter.
Pierre: AI can help with language, especially in English or German. But I would not trust it fully. I would do AI draft, then human review, maybe a mentor or friend. Because AI can make it generic, like everyone.
Anna: Fifth task: portfolio critique.
Pierre: Human, definitely. Portfolio is taste, narrative, what to show, what not. AI can give general tips, but not a deep critique. A mentor who has hired designers is best.
Anna: Sixth task: ideation for a side project, like a portfolio piece.
Pierre: AI is very useful for ideation prompts, because it can push you out of your default. Like, propose project themes combining sustainability, mobility, circular design, whatever. But then I choose and shape it. So AI for sparks, human for meaning.
Anna: If you had to summarise, what is AI good at, and what is it bad at, for you?
Pierre: AI is good at speed, variation, structure, language cleaning. Bad at nuance, taste, context, and emotional truth. And also it can be too generic, like it averages.
Anna: And humans?
Pierre: Humans are good at seeing you, being honest, context, and credibility. But humans are slow, expensive, sometimes biased, sometimes inconsistent. And some humans are nice but not useful.
Anna: Aha, thank you 
7. Trust–effectiveness link
Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human mentoring, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Pierre: Trust is like the entry ticket. If I do not trust the mentor, I will not share the real fears, like the prestige anxiety, family pressure, or that I feel stuck. Then the mentor can only give surface advice, like improve your CV. So trust enables depth. And depth makes it effective.
Anna: What creates that trust, specifically?
Pierre: For humans, it is competence and honesty. Competence means they know the domain, like hardware careers, not just general coaching. Honesty means they tell you what you need to hear, not what you want. Also confidentiality. And feeling seen, like they remember details, they understand my context. And structure, like there is a process.
Anna: Does trust always lead to effectiveness?
Pierre: Not always. Like with my colleague, I trust him, but his advice was not actionable. So trust is necessary, but not sufficient. You can trust someone and still not get results.
Anna: And can you have effectiveness without trust?
Pierre: Yes, like AI naming. Or even with humans, maybe a recruiter gives you a tip that works, but you do not trust their motives, because they want to place you. Still, the tip can be useful. So effectiveness can happen without full trust, but it is limited.
Anna: How does trust affect your willingness to act on advice?
Pierre: If I trust, I act more. Because I believe the advice fits me. If I do not trust, I might still use it, but I treat it like input, not guidance. Like, I take it, but I do not commit.
Anna: And for AI, how does trust relate to effectiveness?
Pierre: For AI, trust is more like, do I believe it is accurate for this task. If I trust it for brainstorming, it is effective because I use it. But for self reflection, I do not trust it, so I do not use it, so it is not effective. Also, if it gives generic answers, trust goes down quickly.
Anna: That makes sense. Do you notice any pattern where AI becomes more trusted over time?
Pierre: Slightly, for specific tasks. Like, I learned what prompts work. So I trust it more in a narrow scope. But not as a partner. More like a tool.
Anna: If you imagine an AI tool designed specifically for career coaching, would that change trust?
Pierre: Maybe, if it is more specialized, like it knows the German market, roles, and it is transparent. But still, I would want a human for big decisions.
8. Preferences and hybrid model reaction
Anna: I want to include a short micro-poll, just quick ratings from 0 to 10. 0 means no trust at all, 10 means complete trust. First: your current trust in human coaches or mentors for career topics. What number comes to mind?
Pierre: For human mentors, I would say 8.
Anna: Why 8, not 10?
Pierre: Because it depends on the person. My mentor was great, but not everyone is. Some coaches are generic or too motivational. So I trust humans if they have competence and honesty. But I do not trust the category automatically.
Anna: Second: trust in AI tools for career related topics.
Pierre: Maybe 4.
Anna: Why 4?
Pierre: Because I trust AI for certain tasks, like brainstorming or language, but not for decisions. And I do not trust nuance. So overall, moderate low.
Anna: Third: perceived effectiveness of human mentoring for your situation right now, 0 to 10.
Pierre: Effectiveness, I would say 7.
Anna: Why 7?
Pierre: Because my mentoring helped, it gave me actions and clarity. But it was limited time, three sessions. And it does not remove the structural reality, like corporate slowness or market uncertainty. So it was effective, but not a magic solution.
Anna: Fourth: perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation right now.
Pierre: For my situation, maybe 5.
Anna: Tell me more.
Pierre: AI is useful as a support tool. It helps me create options, structure, write better. That is effective in small ways. But for the main dilemma, it is not deeply helpful. So it is in the middle.
Anna: Thank you. Now, let us talk about preferences. If you could design an ideal support setup for yourself, would you choose human only, AI only, or hybrid?
Pierre: Hybrid.
Anna: What would hybrid look like for you, concretely?
Pierre: I would want AI first for preparation. Like, I input my background, my constraints, and it helps me map options, prepare questions, generate drafts for CV, maybe even propose a plan. Then I want a human mentor to review, challenge, and adapt it to me. And then maybe AI for follow up, like reminders, templates, and tracking progress. Like, okay, you said you will do one informational interview this week, here is a message draft, here is a checklist. That would be great.
Anna: What would you not want AI to do in that hybrid model?
Pierre: I do not want AI to pretend empathy. Like, I hate when it says, I understand how you feel, but it does not. It feels fake. I would prefer it to be transparent, like, I am a tool, here are options. Also I do not want AI to make big recommendations like, quit your job. That feels dangerous.
Anna: What would you want the human to do that AI cannot?
Pierre: The human should do the deep conversation, the confrontation, the nuance, the reading between lines. Also taste and portfolio critique. And also credibility. Like if a mentor tells me, in Stuttgart hardware, this move makes sense, I believe it more.
Anna: Are there any situations where you would prefer AI over a human, even if a human is available?
Pierre: Yes. For quick tasks. Like I need a cover letter draft at midnight. Or I want to brainstorm side project ideas quickly. Or I do not want to bother a human with small questions. Also sometimes with a human, I feel judged. With AI, you can ask stupid questions.
Anna: Interesting. So psychological safety can be higher with AI sometimes?
Pierre: For small things, yes. Because it is not a person. But for big things, I want a person.
Anna: And when would you prefer human only, no AI?
Pierre: When it is about identity, like what kind of life I want, what kind of work environment. Also when I feel emotional, like fear. AI responses feel flat. A human can respond to emotion.
Anna: You said earlier you worry about startup credibility later. If a mentor says, this startup is good, it will not hurt your CV, would that reduce your anxiety?
Pierre: Yes, because it gives me an external validation. But I also know mentors can be biased. So I would want multiple signals. Still, it helps.
Anna: In your ideal hybrid, how would trust be built?
Pierre: For the human, through competence and honesty. For AI, through consistency and transparency. Like, it shows where information comes from, it admits limits, it does not hallucinate. And maybe it can show examples of people with similar profiles, anonymized, like paths. That would increase trust.
Anna: And how would you know it is effective?
Pierre: If I get clearer targets, like I can name three roles and three types of companies. If I improve my portfolio and get interviews. If I feel less stuck. If I can take actions weekly. And if I feel my story is coherent.
9. Closing
Anna: Before we close, is there anything important about your experience with human mentoring or AI tools for career support that we did not cover?
Pierre: Maybe one thing. In hardware, the stakes are different. Like, mistakes cost money and time. So career advice also needs to respect that. AI tools often feel like software mindset. But hardware is slower, and that is okay. So for me, the right support is not to say, move fast and break things. It is more like, move with intention.
Anna: That is a really clear point. Anything else?
Pierre: Also Stuttgart is special. It is not the most sexy startup city, but there are good companies. The path can be hybrid too. Like corporate innovation teams, or startups connected to corporates. So I am exploring that.
Anna: Great. Thank you, Pierre. Last check, are you still comfortable with everything we discussed being used anonymously for research?
Pierre: Yes, totally.
Anna: Perfect. Thanks again for your time. I will stop the recording now.




Noura 


1) Opening and consent
Anna: Hi Noura, can you hear me well?
Noura: Yes, I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Anna: Yes, perfectly. Thanks for joining. Before we start, I want to check consent. Is it okay if I record this interview? The recording is only for transcription. Everything will be anonymised, and you can skip any question.
Noura: Yes, that is okay. You can record.
Anna: Great. And just to remind you, if anything feels uncomfortable, you can say pass, or we can pause. Any topics you would prefer not to discuss?
Noura: Eehm, no, I think it is fine. Maybe not too many details about my company name, but otherwise okay.
Anna: Absolutely. We will keep it general. Could you also confirm your age and that you are based in Germany?
Noura: Yes. I am 23, and I live in Düsseldorf.
Anna: Perfect. Then we can start.


2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: To begin, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing, or recently faced?
Noura: Okay. Um, so I am finishing my Ausbildung, and at the same time I do part-time studies, business administration. It is one of those dual-ish paths, but not the classic duales Studium, it is more like, Ausbildung in the company and then evening classes, weekend classes. So it is a lot. I work as HR coordinator in a mid-size company here in Düsseldorf. We are like, not a startup, more like, established, maybe around 700 employees in Germany, and then also some international locations.
Anna: And your Ausbildung is in which occupation?
Noura: It is Kauffrau für Büromanagement, but I am placed in HR. So my official apprenticeship title is office management, but practically I am in HR operations. I chose it because I wanted something stable and also because my grades after school were okay, but I was not sure yet what I want to do long-term. And the company offered me HR placement, so I was like, yes, this is interesting.
Anna: What does your current day-to-day look like in that HR coordinator role?
Noura: Eehm. A lot of scheduling. Like, interviews, onboarding appointments, Betriebsarzt appointments, trainings, and also contracts. Not writing the whole contract alone, but preparing templates, checking if all documents are there, sending them to the manager for signature, tracking if the person returns it. And HR system stuff, like data entry in our HRIS, updating addresses, adding working hours, sick leave notes, Urlaub, all that. Plus many emails. Stakeholders write to HR like, can you please urgently do this, and everything is always urgent. Also I support onboarding days. Like the first day, I prepare the welcome package, access badge, laptop request, and I coordinate with IT. And then sometimes I help with training logistics, like booking rooms or Teams links, sending reminders.
Anna: That sounds like a lot of operational pressure.
Noura: Yes. And because I am still Ausbildung, people sometimes treat me like, you are just assisting, but then they still expect perfect accuracy. Like, if one number is wrong in a contract, it is a big problem. And it is stressful because I am also studying. So I do work full-time, then I have two evenings of lectures, and sometimes Saturday. And then I try to also learn extra things because I want to move into people analytics or learning and development. So it is like, three jobs. 
Anna: You mentioned people analytics and learning and development. What drew you to those directions?
Noura: Um. People analytics first, because I noticed in HR there is so much talking and opinions. Like, managers say, oh we have too much sick leave because young people are lazy. And I am like, maybe it is the shift schedule, maybe it is workload, maybe it is leadership. And I like the idea that you can look at data and make a better argument. Also I like Excel. I know it is nerdy, but I like building tables, making it clean, seeing patterns.
And L and D, I am also interested because I like helping people learn, but I am insecure about facilitation. Like if I stand in front and teach, I get nervous. So L and D is attractive, but also scary. People analytics feels like, I can build credibility through numbers. But then I also feel like, do I really have the skills?
Anna: When you say you feel insecure about skills, what is the main insecurity?
Noura: That I lack real expertise or credibility. Like, I am HR coordinator, but I am not HR Business Partner. I do not do strategy. I do not sit in leadership meetings. So sometimes when I think, oh I want to do people analytics, I am like, who am I to say anything? I do not even have access to all the data because of Datenschutz and because I am junior. And then I see people on LinkedIn with titles like People Analytics Manager, and they have masters, they have statistics, they have Python, and I am like, I am just doing onboarding and contracts. So I feel behind.
Anna: What has been the most significant career decision in the last six to twelve months?
Noura: Hmm. The biggest one was deciding to not just stay in HR admin, but to actively ask for a project in analytics. Like, in summer, I had a moment where I was like, okay, I can finish Ausbildung and then just continue as HR admin, and it is stable. My parents would like that, stable job, good company. But I felt like, if I do not move now, I will be stuck. So I asked my HR manager if I can support a project about turnover and onboarding quality. It was not full people analytics, but it included some data. Like, we looked at how many people leave within the first six months, in which departments, and we tried to identify patterns.
Anna: How did it feel to ask for that?
Noura: Scary. Because I thought they will think I am annoying or I am overstepping. And also I was afraid they will ask me questions and I cannot answer. But actually she reacted okay. She said, yes, we can try, but keep it small and make sure it does not affect your operational tasks. So I did it on top. That is the story of my life.
Anna: What made the decision difficult?
Noura: Uncertainty. Like, is it realistic to go into people analytics without a full university degree first? And also fear of mistakes. If I do a report and it is wrong, it will be embarrassing. And pressure because of studies. And also sometimes family expectations, not heavy, but like, they want me to finish something and have security. My parents are from Syria, they came to Germany, they worked hard. So stability is important. They are proud that I have Ausbildung and I study, like, this is very German path, very respectable. But when I say I want to do something like analytics, they are like, okay, but what job is that exactly? They want a clear label.
Anna: And what are you aiming for in the next six to twelve months?
Noura: Finish Ausbildung, for sure. It ends in summer. And then I will continue my part-time studies, maybe I have like, one and a half years left. In the company, I want either a junior role with some development, like junior HR specialist with analytics tasks, or maybe I apply externally for a People Analytics Assistant role, something like that. But I am not sure. I also want to do at least one certification. I was thinking either Power BI or basic SQL. Because I already use Excel, but I want to upgrade.
Anna: So the main questions are, stay internal versus apply outside, and which focus, people analytics versus L and D?
Noura: Yes. Exactly. And also, how to be taken seriously.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Noura: Eehm. Friends a little bit, but my friends are also in Ausbildung or studies, so they are also confused. My family gives emotional support, like, they say you can do it, but they do not know HR market. At work, I sometimes ask one colleague, she is like HR generalist, she is friendly. But I also do not want to bother her too much.
Online resources, yes. Like blogs, YouTube, sometimes German resources like Karrierebibel, but it can be very generic. And then LinkedIn, I tried outreach to mentors. Mixed results. And AI tools, I use them a lot. Mainly for structuring learning plans and preparing interview answers. And also journaling with AI when I am stressed. It feels non-judgmental. I can say anything without worrying about social acceptance.
Anna: When you think about what has actually helped, and what has been unhelpful, what comes to mind?
Noura: Helpful is when it is concrete. Like, someone says, do this next, and explains why. Unhelpful is when it is motivational, like, believe in yourself, and then nothing else. Or when people judge. Like, if someone says, why did you not do university directly, why Ausbildung, like they imply it is less. That makes me shut down.
Anna: In your support sources, do you see any patterns about what you trust?
Noura: I trust when someone understands my context. Like, Germany context, Ausbildung, part-time studies. If someone is like, just do a master abroad, I am like, okay, but that is not helpful for me. And I trust when they do not talk down to me.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust
Anna: Let us talk about the human side first. You mentioned LinkedIn outreach to mentors. Can you walk me through what you did and what happened?
Noura: Sure. Um, I started last year, around October, I think. I was seeing many posts about mentoring, and I felt like, okay, I do not have a network. So I searched for people analytics roles in Germany. I filtered by Düsseldorf, Köln, sometimes Berlin because many roles are there. And then I looked for people who maybe also did Ausbildung or who wrote about non-traditional paths. Then I wrote messages like, hi, I am Noura, I work in HR, I am doing Ausbildung plus part-time studies, I am interested in people analytics, could I ask you two questions or could we have a short call.
Anna: How many did you reach out to, roughly?
Noura: Maybe like, 20? Over time. Not all in one day. Sometimes I wrote three, then I waited. Many did not reply.
Anna: Let us start with a positive interaction. Can you describe one contact that felt helpful and trustworthy?
Noura: Yes. There was one woman, she worked as People Analytics Specialist in a big retail company. Based in Köln. She replied after two days, which already felt like, wow. She said, yes, I can do a 20-minute call, but please send me your questions first, so we can focus. That felt professional. And also she wrote in German, but with a friendly tone, like, klar, machen wir.
Anna: What happened in the call?
Noura: We had a Teams call. I was nervous. She started with, tell me your story. And I explained, Ausbildung, HR coordinator, part-time studies. And I said I feel not credible. And she said, listen, this path is not a weakness. In Germany, Ausbildung is valued. And HR operations gives you understanding of processes and data quality, which is crucial for analytics. She made it sound like, you already have something relevant.
Anna: That sounds validating. What made it feel trustworthy beyond validation?
Noura: She was specific. She asked what HR system we use, what kind of data I touch, like, time tracking, absences, onboarding, recruitment pipeline. Then she said, okay, based on this, your first analytics projects can be descriptive, like dashboards for onboarding and turnover. She explained data access challenges. She said, in Germany, Datenschutz is big, so you need to learn how to phrase questions. Like not, give me individual data, but aggregated patterns, and always ask, what decision will this support. That was super practical.
Anna: Did she give you concrete next steps?
Noura: Yes. She said, for the next three months, pick one tool and go deep. For example, Power BI plus basic SQL. She even suggested a learning order: first understand data tables and joins in SQL, then practice with sample HR datasets, then build dashboards. She also said to do a small internal project and document it, like a mini portfolio. And she offered to review my plan in one month by message. That follow-up offer made me trust her more, because it was consistent.
Anna: What changed for you after that interaction?
Noura: I felt calmer. Like, okay, there is a path. And I asked my manager for that turnover project partly because of this call. Also I started learning SQL basics. I used AI to make a plan, but her advice gave the direction. She also told me which skills are actually used day-to-day, not just trendy. Like, she said, do not panic about Python at the beginning. Excel, SQL, Power BI, and communication is enough for entry.
Anna: Great. Now let us talk about a frustrating interaction.
Noura: Yes, there was one guy. He was like Head of People Analytics something. Very impressive profile. I wrote him a message, and he replied like, sure, send your CV, I can give feedback. I was excited. I sent it. Then he wrote back, very short, like, your profile is weak, you need a university degree, and HR admin is not real HR. It was harsh. And he said, also you should do internships in analytics, otherwise no chance.
Anna: How did that land with you?
Noura: Bad. I cried a bit. Not like, dramatic, but I felt ashamed. Because it confirmed my fear. And the tone felt judging. He did not ask questions. He did not understand that I am already working full-time. He just compared me to a standard path. Also he never answered again after that. Like, he dropped the bomb and disappeared.
Anna: That is a strong example. What did it do to your willingness to seek human mentoring?
Noura: It made me hesitant. I was like, okay, maybe I should not ask people. It felt like, if I am not already perfect, they will judge. And also, ghosting is common. Some people say, yes, let us schedule, then they never send times. Or they reply with generic lines like, keep learning, network more, and that is it. That feels like, not effective.
Anna: When you think about trust drivers for humans, based on these experiences, what stands out?
Noura: For humans, trust is about feeling safe. Like, I can share insecurity without being laughed at. Confidentiality also, like, I do not want my colleagues to know I am planning to leave. With a LinkedIn mentor, it is weird, because you do not know them. But still, you want discretion. Empathy, but also being taken seriously. Practical knowledge, like understanding Germany HR market, privacy rules, what skills matter. And consistency, like if they say they will follow up, they do.
Anna: And what about distrust drivers?
Noura: Judgment, obvious. Also when they are too vague. Or when they push their own agenda, like, they want to sell coaching or courses. And also mismatch, like they are in Berlin startup world and they cannot relate to Düsseldorf corporate HR.
Anna: You mentioned earlier that sometimes someone can be kind but not helpful. Do you have an example?
Noura: Yes. There was a woman, she was super kind. She wrote long messages like, you are doing great, you are strong, I believe in you. Very sweet. But when I asked, okay, how do I move into people analytics, she said, just follow your passion, apply and it will happen. That was trusted in a way, because she was safe and kind. But it was not effective. I ended the chat feeling warm, but still lost.
Anna: That is a clear trusted but not effective example.
Noura: Yes, exactly.
5) AI tools: experience and trust
Anna: Let us shift to AI tools. You said you have experience using AI for learning plans and interview answers, and also for journaling when stressed. Can you describe how you use it in practice?
Noura: Sure. I use, um, like conversational AI tools, mostly ChatGPT. Sometimes also the one in Microsoft, but mostly ChatGPT. I use it in English, sometimes in German. My English is okay, especially for work topics. German is my everyday language, but for structured stuff, I sometimes prefer English because the output feels more direct. Arabic I speak with my family, but I do not use it for career stuff.
Anna: And what are the typical tasks you use AI for?
Noura: Learning plan: like, I say, I have 6 hours per week, I want to learn SQL and Power BI, I have HR background, make me a 8-week plan with topics and small exercises. Or I say, explain joins like I am beginner, and give me practice questions. Also for interviews: I paste a job description and my CV, and ask for possible interview questions and STAR answers. Then I practice.
And journaling: when I am stressed, I write like, I feel overwhelmed, I feel stupid, I feel like I am failing. And it responds in a calm way. It asks me questions. It is non-judgmental. That is the key. I can say anything without worrying about social acceptance. If I tell my friend, I feel stupid, they might say, no you are not, stop. But with AI, I can be messy.
Anna: Can you describe a specific stress moment where you used AI journaling, and what it did for you emotionally?
Noura: Yes. There was a day in November. I had work, and then lecture, and then I got an email from a manager saying, why is the contract wrong, this is unacceptable. And it was a small mistake in start date format, but he wrote very angry. I felt my stomach drop. And then after lecture, I came home at like 22:30, and I was shaking. I was like, I cannot do this, I am not good enough.
So I opened AI chat and wrote everything. Like, I am overwhelmed, I make mistakes, people think I am incompetent, I want to quit. And it responded like, it reflected my feelings, and it said, this is a stressful environment, mistakes happen, and it asked me to separate facts from interpretations. It asked, what exactly happened, what is the evidence that you are incompetent, what would you say to a friend. It felt like guided journaling.
Anna: And what changed after that?
Noura: I felt relief. Like, I could breathe. It made me calmer. Not magically happy, but calmer. And then it helped me write a professional reply to the manager. Like, short, acknowledging the correction, and then I fixed it. So it was emotional regulation plus practical.
Anna: When you think about trust in AI, what makes you trust it, and what makes you not trust it?
Noura: Trust drivers for AI: it is always available. It is non-judgmental. It helps structure. It can break down a big thing into steps. It also does not get tired of my questions. For example, joins, I ask five times, it still answers.
But trust issues: accuracy varies. Sometimes it is too confident. Like it says something and it sounds right, but it is not. And privacy uncertainty exists. I do not paste very sensitive company data. I do not put names or internal numbers. But still, you wonder, where does it go.
Anna: Do you have an example of a moment AI helped with a learning plan, something concrete?
Noura: Yes. In December, I wanted to learn SQL, but I was overwhelmed by all resources. I asked AI: I am HR coordinator, I want people analytics, I have basic Excel, no coding, 6 hours per week, make me a plan. It gave me weekly topics: week one, select statements, filtering, sorting. Week two, group by and aggregates. Week three, joins. Week four, subqueries. Then it suggested small HR examples, like, employee table, absence table. That made it feel relevant.
Then I followed it and I created a small fake dataset in Excel, and I practiced queries. It gave me exercises like, find departments with highest turnover. That was fun. It also suggested to track progress and do mini projects. So I built a small dashboard in Power BI with a sample dataset. That gave me confidence.
Anna: And a moment AI did not help?
Noura: Many. One moment: I asked for a plan, and it was generic. Like, learn statistics, learn Python, learn machine learning, build portfolio, network, apply. It was like, everything. And I was like, okay, this is not realistic. Another moment: I asked about German HR data privacy rules, like what is allowed for analytics, and it gave a confident answer that sounded like legal advice. And I was like, hmm, I am not sure. It did not mention Betriebsrat involvement properly. So I realized, okay, this can be wrong. It can also make assumptions. Like it assumes you can access data easily, but in my company, access is restricted.
Anna: So effective sometimes, but you double-check.
Noura: Yes. It can be effective but not fully trusted. Like, it gives useful structure, but I verify.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks
Anna: I want to compare human versus AI through specific tasks. Let us take CV and interview preparation first. For that, what feels more useful, human support or AI?
Noura: AI is more useful for speed. Like, I can paste my CV and job description and get questions, and it gives me drafts. It also helps me phrase things in a more professional way, especially in English. But I do not fully trust it, because sometimes it exaggerates. It adds skills I do not have. So I have to correct.
Human is useful for realism. Like, the mentor from Köln told me, do not try to be everything, focus on what is credible. That is human judgment. But I do not always have access to humans. So AI wins for availability.
Anna: How about deciding between people analytics and L and D? Which helps more?
Noura: For deep decision, human helps more, if the human is good. Because they can ask questions, they can understand values, and they can challenge gently. AI can ask questions too, but it sometimes feels scripted. Still, AI is good for exploring. Like, I can say, give me pros and cons, give me day-to-day tasks, give me possible entry roles. That is helpful.
Anna: And for learning plans?
Noura: AI is very effective for learning plans. It is like a personal tutor. But sometimes it is too broad. Human can also help, but most humans will not sit and build a weekly plan with you. So AI is better.
Anna: For emotional support, like stress and confidence?
Noura: This is interesting. AI journaling is surprisingly good for immediate calming, because it is non-judgmental. Human support is deeper, but also risky. Like, with humans, you worry about being judged. With AI, you can say anything. But then human can give real empathy, like tone, facial expression, and also you know they are a person. AI empathy feels like, simulated. Still, it works on me sometimes.
Anna: For navigating workplace politics or stakeholder issues?
Noura: Human is better, because they know context. AI can give templates, like how to write an email, how to set boundaries. But humans can say, in Germany, with Betriebsrat, you must consider this. AI can miss nuance.
Anna: Do you feel you trust humans more overall, or AI more overall?
Noura: Hmm. Overall I trust humans more for high-stakes decisions, but I trust AI more for private messy thoughts. Because humans can judge.
7) Trust–effectiveness link (including micro-poll ratings)

Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human support, like mentors or coaches, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Noura: Trust is like, the door. If I trust, I share the real problem. Like I can say, I feel not credible, I am afraid. If I do not trust, I will just ask surface questions, like, what course should I do. Then the advice is surface. So trust enables depth, and depth makes it effective.
Anna: And if you do not trust, what happens?
Noura: I filter myself. I try to look strong. Then I do not get help with the real thing. So it is less effective.
Anna: How about AI? How does trust affect effectiveness there?
Noura: With AI, if I do not trust accuracy, I do not follow the advice. I might still use it as brainstorming. Like, it can be effective as a mirror, even if I do not trust it as truth. But if it makes a wrong assumption, it can confuse me. So trust in AI is more like, trust in reliability and boundaries. If I know it is good for structuring, then it is effective for that. If I mistakenly trust it for legal topics, it can be harmful. So I keep it in its lane.
Anna: That is a nice way to put it, keep it in its lane. I would like to include a quick micro-poll. I will ask for ratings from 0 to 10. 0 means no trust at all, 10 means complete trust. First, your current trust in human coaches or mentors for career support, generally. What number comes to mind?
Noura: Um. Maybe 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Noura: Because I had one good experience, which raises it. But many people ghost or judge, or give generic advice. So I cannot say 8 or 9. But it is not 2, because humans can be very helpful if the match is right. So 6.
Anna: Next, your trust in AI tools for career-related support, 0 to 10.
Noura: I would say 7.
Anna: Interesting, slightly higher. Why 7?
Noura: Because it is consistent in being available and non-judgmental. And for structuring and interview prep, it is usually helpful. But I do not give it 9 because accuracy varies and privacy is uncertain. So 7.
Anna: Now perceived effectiveness. For your situation specifically, how effective has human support been, 0 to 10?
Noura: Hmm. Maybe 5.
Anna: Why 5?
Noura: Because the good mentor gave me direction, but overall, I did not get ongoing support. And some interactions made me feel worse. So the net effect is medium. If I had a good coach consistently, it could be higher.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10?
Noura: I would say 8.
Anna: Why 8?
Noura: Because I actually use it weekly, and it gives me concrete things: learning plan, practice, interview answers, email drafts, journaling. It reduces stress. It helps me make progress. But I keep one point off because sometimes it is wrong or too generic, and I need to double-check.
Anna: Great. Thank you. You already gave one example of trusted but not effective, the kind mentor with vague advice. Can you give an example of effective but not fully trusted, besides the legal topic?
Noura: Yes. Interview answers. AI can generate very strong answers, like perfect STAR stories. It is effective as a template. But I do not fully trust it, because it can make me sound like someone else. And sometimes it adds metrics that I cannot prove. So it is useful, but I have to edit. So it is effective, but not trusted as final truth.
Anna: That makes sense.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction

Anna: Now imagine a hybrid model where AI supports you for preparation, reflection, and structuring, and then a human mentor or coach steps in for key decisions, context, and accountability. How does that sound to you?
Noura: Honestly, that sounds ideal. Because I want the speed and privacy of AI, but I also want human validation and reality check. Especially for credibility questions. Like, am I on the right track, am I overselling, is this realistic in Germany.
Anna: What would you want the AI part to do, and what would you want the human part to do?
Noura: AI part: learning plan, practice questions, explain concepts, help me draft applications, help me reflect when stressed, help me prepare for interviews. Also help me organize options, like list roles, required skills, timeline.
Human part: feedback on my plan, like, is it too ambitious, is it missing something. Also help me with identity and confidence, but in a real way. And networking guidance. Like, in Düsseldorf HR market, which companies have people analytics teams, how to approach them. And also accountability, like, check in with me, did you do the plan, adjust.
Anna: What would make you trust a human in such a hybrid model?
Noura: Feeling safe, confidentiality, empathy, being taken seriously, practical knowledge, and consistency. And also transparency about their background. Like, are they really experienced in people analytics or L and D, or are they general career coach who knows nothing about HR. I want someone who understands HR.
Anna: And what would make you trust the AI part more?
Noura: Clear boundaries and transparency, like what it is good at and what not. Also privacy clarity. And maybe sources. Like, if it says, in Germany, HR analytics often requires this, and it links to something credible, that would help. Also if it remembers my context correctly. Sometimes it forgets, and then it gives advice that does not fit.
Anna: How do you feel about the idea that AI could match you to a human mentor based on your goals and preferences?
Noura: That would be great, because LinkedIn outreach is random. You do not know who will reply, and you cannot see if they are actually supportive. If there was matching, like, you can choose someone with a similar path, or someone who is not judgmental, that would help trust.
Anna: What are your concerns about a hybrid model?
Noura: Cost. Because I am early career, I do not have money for expensive coaching. Also quality control. Like, how do you ensure the human is good and not just motivational. And time. If the human is not responsive, it ruins it. Also data privacy: if AI collects my information and shares it with a human, I would want control. Like, I want to decide what is shared.
Anna: If you could design the ideal experience, how would it work?
Noura: I would start with AI onboarding, like I explain my situation, my constraints, Ausbildung, part-time studies, Düsseldorf, HR coordinator, goals. Then AI suggests a few paths and learning plan. Then it suggests three mentors that fit. I choose one. Then I have a short call with the mentor, like 30 minutes, to validate plan and set goals. Then AI supports me weekly with tasks. Then every month, a human check-in, like, adjust and reflect. That would be perfect.
Anna: Would you prefer the human check-ins to be video, or chat, or voice?
Noura: Video, at least sometimes. Because trust builds with seeing the person. But sometimes chat is okay for quick questions. A mix.
Anna: If you had to choose only one, only AI or only human, which would you pick right now?
Noura: Right now, only AI. Because I actually have access and it helps me. Human is too uncertain. But ideally, hybrid.
Anna: That is very clear.
9. Closing

Anna: Before we end, is there anything important about your experience with career support, trust, or effectiveness that we did not cover?
Noura: Maybe one thing. Um. In Germany, there is this feeling of career ladder and titles. Like, people want you to have the correct degree for the correct job. And that makes me insecure. So any support that understands that, and helps me translate my path into credible story, that is what I need. AI helps me write the story. Human helps me believe it.
Anna: That is a strong closing point. If you think about the next month, what is one concrete step you want to take?
Noura: Finish my SQL basics module, like, consistent. And also maybe ask at work if I can get access to some aggregated data for another small analysis, like training participation. Something small.
Anna: Great. Thank you, Noura. I will stop the recording now. And thank you again for sharing, especially the difficult parts. 
Anna: I am glad. Have a good evening.
Noura: You too. Bye.




Slava
1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Slava. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything is anonymous, you can skip any question, and you can stop at any time.
Slava: Yes, you have my permission. Recording is okay. And thanks for saying I can skip. That helps already. Um.
Anna: Good. Just to confirm, we will use a pseudonym and remove any identifying details like company name or exact people. If I ask something that feels too sensitive, just tell me and we move on. Any topics you prefer not to discuss today?
Slava: Maybe, eehm, nothing super specific. I just do not want to talk about like exact incident names, like safety incidents with names, because it gets tricky. But general, yes, we can talk.
Anna: Perfect. We will keep it general. And I might interrupt lightly to clarify, but I will try not to lead you. Ready?
Slava: Yes. Ready.
2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: To start, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now?
Slava: Okay. So, I am 30. I am from Poland originally. I moved to Germany eight years ago, first to Dresden actually, and then Leipzig. Now I am in Leipzig since, I think, six years. I work in logistics operations for a big retail chain. Like, everyone knows it, but I will not say the name. It is large, nationwide. I work in a distribution center that supplies stores in the region.
And my role now is operations manager, like a logistics operations manager. I manage multiple shifts, multiple areas, like inbound, outbound, picking, also some returns. It is, um, high pressure.
My main question right now is: do I continue in operations and go up, like senior operations, site lead path, or do I try to move into consulting or strategy, like internal strategy team or external consulting. And it sounds, like, clean when I say it, but emotionally it is not clean at all. 
Anna: What makes it not clean emotionally?
Slava: Because operations is my identity now. I am good at it. I have a reputation. Like, if you ask people, they say Slava delivers. And I do. But I am also close to burnout. And I can feel it. And the idea of consulting is like, maybe more intellectual, maybe more control, maybe more future options. But also it is like fantasy and reality mixed. So I am in this tension.
Anna: When did this tension become sharp for you? Was there a trigger moment?
Slava: Yes. In the last, maybe, nine months. It got really sharp in, I would say, spring and summer. Because we had, like, a reorganization. And we also had higher sick leave. Krankenstand was crazy. And we had pressure from headquarters because costs. Also, service level had to stay high. So basically the same output with less people and less overtime. That is always the joke, right.
Anna: You mentioned you are close to burnout. How do you notice it in yourself?
Slava: Sleep. First sleep. I wake up at 3:40 or 4:10 and my brain is already running. Like I open eyes and it is already a shift plan in my head. Or it is like, what if the sorter stops, what if the last mile carrier rejects volume, what if we miss the cut-off. And then I cannot fall asleep again. Then irritability. I snap. Not always at people, but like internally I am angry. Also with my partner I am less patient. Small things annoy me, like the dishwasher not loaded correctly. It is stupid.
Anna: Oh 
Slava: And then constant firefighting. Even when I am not at work, I check my phone. There are WhatsApp messages and Teams messages. I try not to, but I do. Weekend messages. I have this feeling like I am always responsible. Like a weight.
Slava: Also physical. I have shoulder tension, headaches, and I started to get like stomach issues. Not dramatic but you feel it. My partner says, you are not present. You are there but not there.
Anna: That sounds heavy. In the last 6 to 12 months, what was the biggest career decision you made?
Slava: The biggest decision was whether to accept a promotion to take over another area, like a bigger scope. It was like, okay, you become responsible for outbound plus last mile coordination, not only warehouse outbound. That means more stakeholders, more stress, but also more visibility. And I said yes. And now I am like, why did I say yes. But also, I learned a lot.
Anna: What made that decision difficult at the time?
Slava: I felt like if I say no, it means I am not ambitious. And I have this thing, maybe from Poland, like, you come to Germany, you want to prove yourself. You want to show you are not the immigrant guy who is lucky to have a job. You know. So I said yes. Also, money. It was not huge, but it was something. And status. And also, I had a good relationship with my boss. He was like, I believe in you. So I did not want to disappoint. But the difficult part was I already felt tired. Like, I already felt, okay, I am at 80 percent capacity. And then I took 120 percent scope. That is not smart.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed during that decision?
Slava: Someone to help me think with distance. Like, is this good for you, not only for career. And also someone who understands operations, because many people just say, take the promotion, it is good. But they do not understand what it means, like shift calls at night, escalation, works council topics, staffing chaos.
Anna: When you say you did not have that person, does that relate to mentoring or coaching experiences?
Slava: Yes.


3. Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Slava: Eehm. Usually, long walks. That is my main. I walk along the canal, Karl-Heine-Kanal, or in Auwald. I just walk, like one hour, two hours, sometimes more. And I think. It is like processing. Second, I talk to my partner. She is German, from Saxony, and she is in healthcare, like not HR. But she is good at listening. And she tells me when I am making stupid assumptions.And she helps me calm down.
Anna: Anything else? 
Slava: I use AI tools, a lot, but more for planning, scenario analysis, writing. Not for self reflection. I do not like to tell a chat my feelings. It feels, I do not know, sterile.
Slava: Also friends. But friends are not really helpful for career strategy because they are either in similar stress or they just say, it will be fine. Which is supportive but not helpful. I mean, no wait, let me rephrase. Friends help emotionally, but not with clarity.
Anna: Do you use any formal career services, like university services, networks, professional coaching?
Slava: Not now. I used to, like, early on I had one mentor. That was the only structured thing. After that, nothing structured. I sometimes watch videos, podcasts, like consulting content, or operations leadership content. But it is not like a person.
Anna: What has actually helped in the past, and what felt unhelpful or frustrating?
Slava: Helped: my early mentor, and also some managers who gave direct feedback. Like, German directness sometimes is painful, but it can be helpful. Unhelpful like, find your passion. Or, just apply. Or, work life balance is important. Like, ja, danke. That does not solve anything. Also, sometimes HR internal programs are more like checkbox. They say you can move internally, but then there is no real path.
Anna: If you think about the kind of support you wish you had now, what is missing?
Slava: A mentor who understands business roles and also understands psychology. Like someone with psychologist background who works in HR, or a full time career mentor who has business context. Because I need both. I need someone who can help me regulate, like, stress, emotions, and also someone who can say, okay, consulting is like this, strategy is like this, your skills transfer like this, here is a plan. And I do not know where to find that.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust

Anna: You mentioned one powerful mentoring relationship early in your career. Can you tell me that story? How did you meet, what made it powerful?
Slava: Yes. It was when I moved to Germany. I started in warehouse, like entry level. I was doing picking, then I became team lead. I was hungry, like, I wanted to learn everything. I was also insecure because my German was not good. I had like B1, maybe B2, but in logistics slang it is different. My mentor was a manager in the site, not my direct boss, but like one level above. He noticed me because I was always asking questions, and also I was doing like small improvements. Like I made a simple Excel to track some errors and root causes. Nothing crazy. But he saw it. He invited me for coffee. And at first I thought, okay, I am in trouble.  Because in warehouse, if a manager calls you, it is usually not good. But he said, no, I just see potential.We met every two weeks. Sometimes in the canteen, sometimes outside. He would ask me, what do you want, what do you struggle with. And he was very direct. He said, you are fast and smart, but you are also, how to say, too eager to please. And he said, you need to learn boundaries, and you need to learn stakeholder management, not just doing work.
Anna: What did he do that created trust for you?
Slava: First, confidentiality. He explicitly said, what we talk stays here, unless you want me to escalate something. That was big for me. Because I was afraid to look weak.Second, he understood the context. He knew operations. He knew the pressure. He knew KPIs. So when I said, I feel overwhelmed, he did not say, take a vacation. He said, okay, what is the load, what can be delegated, what is system problem. Also he challenged me. Not only empathy. He would say, you complain but you also create your own chaos. And it was true. He made me see patterns. Also, he remembered details. Like, next time he asked, how was your night shift, what happened with that supervisor. Feeling seen. That is trust for me.
Anna: Do you remember a specific moment or feedback that stayed with you?
Slava: Yes. There was one moment, I had a conflict with a German supervisor. He thought I was too pushy, too direct. I thought he was lazy. It was messy. I came to mentor and I was like, he does not respect me because I am Polish. I was angry. And my mentor listened. Then he said, okay, maybe. But also maybe you are communicating like in Poland, more like, do it now, and in Germany, people want more context, more agreement. Especially with works council culture. He said, if you want respect, you need to speak in their logic. Use facts, use process, not emotion. And he taught me how to have that conversation. He even role played with me, like, what to say, how to say. And after I did it, the relationship improved. It was not perfect, but it was better. And I learned something: trust is not only being nice, it is being helpful in a concrete way.
Anna: What changed in your career after that mentoring relationship?
Slava: A lot. I got moved to a better role. I became shift manager earlier than I would. And I also got confidence. Like, I started to feel I belong. And also I learned to think bigger, not only day to day.
Anna: And then you said after that, nothing structured. What happened?
Slava: He left the company. He moved to another city. And after that, the culture changed. New leadership. And I also moved to Leipzig. In Leipzig, I had good bosses but no one like that. Also I became more senior, so people assume you do not need help. But actually you need more.
Anna: Today, when you think of having a mentor or coach, what would you expect? And what would make you trust them?
Slava: I would expect structure. Like, not just random talks. A process. Maybe goals. Accountability. Trust drivers for human: confidentiality, feeling seen, empathy plus challenge, and industry understanding. Also not judging burnout. If someone is like, you are weak, then no. I need someone who can say, burnout risk is real, but also, you have choices. And I want someone who understands Germany context. Like, works councils, Betriebsrat, sick leave norms, and also internal mobility. Because sometimes advice from US content is like, just quit. That is not realistic.
Anna: Have you ever had a human support that you trusted, but it was not effective?
Slava: Yes. My partner, sometimes. I trust her fully. She is very supportive. But if I ask, should I move to consulting, she cannot answer. She can help me calm down, but she cannot give steps. So I trust, but not effective for that specific task. And also friends. They are loyal, but they do not move me forward.
Anna: That distinction is helpful. Anything else you want to add about what you do not want in a human coach?
Slava: I do not want someone who is too soft and just validates. I also do not want someone who is like a guru. I want practical. And I want someone who can handle complexity. And I want boundaries, like, what they can do, what they cannot do.
 5) AI tools: experience and trust

Anna: Let us shift to AI tools. You said you use AI heavily for planning, scenario analysis, and writing reports. Can you walk me through how you actually use it in your work?
Slava: Yes. So I use AI almost daily. For example, peak season planning. We have like Easter peak, summer peak, and then Christmas, Black Friday, all that. We need to forecast volume, staffing, overtime, temp agency. I take historical data, like shipments, order lines, pick rate, absenteeism. I put it in my own spreadsheets. Then I use AI to help me think through scenarios. Like, if volume increases 12 percent, and sick leave stays at 8 percent, what staffing do I need to maintain OTIF. Or if we cannot get enough temps, what levers do we have. AI helps me structure options and risks. Also risk logs. Like, we do weekly risk register. AI helps me write it cleaner, more executive language. Because operations people write messy. I am included. And report writing. Every week I send an update to regional director. It must be crisp. AI helps with rewriting, making it more structured, less emotional.
Also incident postmortems. When a sorter breaks and we miss cut-off, we do a postmortem. AI helps me create a template: timeline, root cause, corrective actions, preventive actions.
Anna: Can you give one moment where AI helped a lot?
Slava: Yes. Last year, like October, we had a problem with last mile carrier capacity. They suddenly reduced trucks due to driver shortage. And we had store deliveries at risk. My boss asked me to prepare an escalation message to headquarters and also propose mitigation plan, within like two hours. I had all the messy notes. I used AI to structure it: situation, impact, options, recommendation, request. It produced a very clear message. I still edited, but it saved me, honestly. And the tone was better than my angry tone.  Also it suggested a mitigation I did not think: shifting some volume to alternative cross-dock in the region, even if cost is higher, for only two weeks. We did something similar. So it helped.
Anna: And one moment where AI failed, or felt risky?
Slava: Yes. Two things. First, hallucinated numbers. I once asked it to summarize a dataset and I gave it like a table. And it confidently said, absenteeism decreased by 3 percent, but actually it increased. It misunderstood. And if I would copy paste that, I would look stupid. So I learned: never trust numbers unless I verify. Also confidentiality and senses. We have works council topics, like shift patterns, overtime, performance. If I put too much detail into AI, it is risky. Also HR sensitivity. For example, I wanted to write a note about a supervisor performance issue. AI suggested language that was too direct, like, terminate or replace. In Germany, you cannot just say that. Also it can create legal issues. So I do not use AI for personal HR cases. I keep it for general structure and anonymized.
Anna: So when you talk about trust in AI, what drives it for you?
Slava: Speed, structure, low effort. It is always available. Also it is consistent. And it does not judge. Like, if I ask stupid question, it does not laugh. But emotional safety is limited. And nuance is limited. Also, it can be overconfident. So trust is conditional. I trust it to help me draft, structure, brainstorm. I do not trust it as final truth.
Anna: You said you do not use AI for self reflection. Can you explain why? What do long walks and partner talks give you instead?
Slava: Yes. AI feels like talking into a mirror that answers. But it is not a human. For self reflection, I need silence. I need my body to calm down. When I walk, my nervous system goes down. I breathe. I notice things. I remember what actually matters. And with my partner, I get real feedback. She can see my face. She can say, you are lying to yourself. AI cannot do that in the same way. Also, there is intimacy. Like, I can be weak. I do not want to be weak with a tool. Even if it is safe, it feels weird. Also I do not want to create habit of outsourcing my feelings. I want to process them myself. Maybe it is old school.
6. Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: I want to compare human and AI via concrete tasks. I will name a task and you tell me which you would prefer and why. First: writing a report for senior leadership about weekly performance and risks.
Slava: AI first. Because it can structure fast. I still verify. But AI is effective there. Human mentor would be slower, and also they would not be in my inbox at 23:00. AI is. 
Anna: Second: scenario planning for peak season staffing and capacity.
Slava: AI plus me. Like, AI helps generate scenarios, but I need domain knowledge. A human could help if they have operations background, but it is rare. Most coaches do not know picking rate and cut-off times. So AI is more practical.
Anna: Third: deciding whether to move from operations into consulting or strategy.
Slava: Human. 100 percent. AI can give pros and cons, but it cannot feel my situation. It cannot challenge my avoidance. It cannot hold me accountable.
Anna: Fourth: preparing a CV and cover letter for consulting roles.
Slava: AI for drafting and structure, human for positioning. Like, AI can make it pretty, but human mentor can say, this is the story, this is credible, this is what consulting wants. AI can guess, but it is generic.
Anna: Fifth: practicing an interview, especially case interview style.
Slava: Hybrid. AI for practice questions and feedback quick. Human for real pressure, like, interrupting, probing, seeing if I am confident. Also human can tell if I sound like operations guy who is hiding insecurity.
Anna: Sixth: managing your burnout risk and boundaries at work.
Slava: Human. Because I need empathy plus challenge. AI can suggest time management tips, but it will not handle the messy reality, like my boss calling, or works council conflict, or guilt. Human can.
Anna: Is there any area where you feel AI is effective even if you do not fully trust it?
Slava: Yes. Report writing. Sometimes it produces a very strong narrative. It sounds confident, like consultant language. It is effective. But I do not fully trust it. I verify every claim. So it is like, effective output, but trust is partial. I rely on it as a tool, not as authority.
Anna: And is there any area where you trust a human but they might not be effective?
Slava: Yes, like I said, supportive people who listen but do not give steps. Also, some managers who are nice but they do not have time. They say, yeah, you can move internally, and then nothing happens. I trust they mean well, but it is not effective.
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human mentoring or coaching, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Slava: Trust is like entry ticket. If I do not trust, I will not say the real thing. I will say the safe version. Like, I am busy. Not like, I am scared, or I feel trapped, or I fantasize about leaving because I hate this. If I do not trust, then the coach works on surface.When I trusted my mentor early on, I told him, I feel like outsider, I feel angry, I feel insecure. And then he could help. So trust enables depth. Depth enables effectiveness.
Anna: What are your indicators that mentoring or coaching is effective for you?
Slava: Concrete steps. Not only feelings. Like, after a session, I want a plan: this week do X, next week do Y. Also reduced overwhelm. Like, I feel lighter, I can breathe. Better decisions. Like, I stop looping in my head and I choose. Also energy. If coaching is effective, I have more energy, not less. And for transition, effectiveness would mean: credible plan to move, maybe applications sent, interviews, or at least informational interviews. Not only dreaming.
Anna: And how does trust affect effectiveness with AI tools for you?
Slava: Different. With AI, trust is more like reliability. If I see it makes mistakes, I trust less, so I verify more. Effectiveness can still be high because it saves time, but trust changes how I use it. Also if I do not trust it with confidentiality, I will not put sensitive info. So it limits usefulness. For example, I cannot ask it, how to handle this specific works council conflict, because I cannot share details. So trust boundaries reduce effectiveness.
Anna:Can you name the main trust drivers for AI in your case, and the main trust drivers for humans, clearly separated?
Slava: Okay. For humans feeling seen, confidentiality, empathy plus challenge, industry understanding, no judgment about burnout, and structured accountability. Like, they keep me on track. For AI speed, structure, low effort, availability. Also it is consistent. But trust is limited by overconfidence, hallucinations, and confidentiality risks. And lack of emotional nuance.
Anna: And effectiveness indicators, also separated, for your situation?
Slava: Human effectiveness would be: clarity on direction, concrete transition plan, better boundaries, less burnout, and progress like interviews.AI effectiveness is: better planning, faster writing, clearer reports, scenario options, and reducing cognitive load in operations tasks.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction (with micro-poll ratings)

Anna: I want to include a short micro-poll, just to structure the comparison. I will ask four ratings from 0 to 10, and I want you to explain briefly. First: your current trust in human coaches or mentors for career topics, 0 to 10.
Slava: Um. I would say 7 out of 10. Because I had one very good mentor, so I know it can be great. But I also know many coaches are generic. And I worry about people who do not understand operations. So I am open, but not blindly.
Anna: What would move it from 7 to 9?
Slava: Clear proof of understanding my context, like retail logistics, KPIs, shift reality. And confidentiality. And also if they have psychologist background, because then I feel they can handle stress topics without making it weird.
Anna: Second rating: trust in AI tools for career related or work related support, 0 to 10.
Slava: For work tasks, like planning and reports, trust is 6. For career guidance, trust is lower, maybe 4 or 5. But overall if you force me one number, I say 6 out of 10.
Anna: Why 6?
Slava: Because it is useful and often correct in structure. But I have seen mistakes. And the confidence is dangerous. Also privacy. So I trust it as assistant, not as expert.
Anna: Third rating: perceived effectiveness of human mentoring or coaching for your current situation, 0 to 10.
Slava: If I had the right person, it could be 9. But in reality, given I do not have it now, I would say 7. Like, I believe it is effective, but access is the problem.
Anna: What makes you believe it could be 9 with the right person?
Slava: Because of my early mentor. I saw how one person can change your trajectory. Also because my problem is not only technical. It is identity and stress and choices. Humans are better for that.
Anna: Fourth rating: perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your current situation, 0 to 10.
Slava: For my operations tasks, 8. For the transition question, maybe 5. Overall, if one number, I say 7.
Anna: So trust in AI is 6, effectiveness is 7. Trust in humans is 7, effectiveness is 7, with potential higher. Is that fair?
Slava: Yes. That is fair. AI is like, effective worker. Human is like, potential deeper shift.
Anna: Now I will describe a hybrid model very briefly, and you tell me your reaction. Imagine a career support service where AI helps you prepare, structure your thoughts, draft CV and messages, and track tasks between sessions. Then you have sessions with a human mentor who is matched to you based on background and style, and they focus on deeper decision making, accountability, and emotional regulation. How does that land for you?
Slava: Honestly, that is exactly what I want. Because I already use AI for prep. But I do not have the human part. The matching is key. Like, I do not want random coach. I want someone who understands business roles, maybe consulting, maybe HR, and ideally psychology background. Because if I am close to burnout, I need someone who can spot patterns, like perfectionism, guilt, over responsibility. Also I like the idea AI tracks tasks. Because I am good at work tasks, but for my own career I procrastinate. So if AI says, hey, you said you will message two people on LinkedIn, did you do it, it could help. But it must not be creepy. It must feel like tool, not surveillance.
Anna: What would make it feel creepy?
Slava: If it collects too much. If it stores sensitive personal notes. Also if it is not transparent. Like, who sees what. If the human mentor can see my AI conversations, I need control. Because sometimes I might write things I do not want to share.
Anna: How would you prefer the division of labor between AI and human in such a model?
Slava: Preparation, brainstorming, structure, drafts, reminders, maybe practice questions.For human decision sessions, value clarification, burnout boundaries, and reality check about consulting. Like, consulting is not vacation. Also human should help with network strategy. Like, who to talk to, how to position my story.
Anna: You said earlier you do not know where to find that kind of mentor. What have you tried so far?
Slava: I tried LinkedIn. But it is noisy. Everyone is like coach. Hard to tell quality. I also looked at internal programs, but they are more leadership training, not career transition. I asked one colleague who moved to consulting. He gave me tips, but it was one conversation. Not ongoing. I also considered paying for coaching, but I do not know how to choose. Like, I fear spending money and getting generic advice.
Anna: What signals would you look for to evaluate a mentor or coach?
Slava: Case examples. Like, have they helped people transition from ops to consulting. Also their questions. If first call they ask deep questions, not selling. Also if they can explain their method. Like, how they work. And if they can talk about confidentiality clearly. Also vibe. Like, do I feel safe and also challenged. Not only friendly.
9) Closing

Anna: We are close to the end. If you imagine yourself six months from now, what would be a good outcome, realistically?
Slava: Realistic good outcome: I have a clear plan. Either I commit to operations but with boundaries, maybe internal move to less firefighting role, like process improvement, continuous improvement. Or I commit to consulting path and I have already done like, five informational interviews and maybe applied to some roles. Also I would like to feel healthier. Like, sleep better. Not checking phone every weekend. That would be success.
Anna: If you could give advice to someone designing career support, based on your experience, what would you emphasize?
Slava: Do not underestimate burnout and emotional load in operations. People think it is just logistics. But it is people, safety, pressure, and you feel responsible. Also, do not make advice generic. People need context. And give structure, like steps, not only inspiration. And for AI, be transparent about limits and privacy. Otherwise people will not trust with important topics.
Anna: Anything you wish I asked but did not?
Slava: Maybe about consulting fantasy. Like, I know it is also pressure, travel, long hours. But I still want it because it feels like growth. I guess that is enough.
Anna: We can end on that. Thank you, Slava. Your examples were very concrete and helpful. I will stop the recording now.
Slava:Thank you. It was good to know you. Okay i




Silvia


1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Silvia, can you hear me well?
Silvia: Yes.
Anna: Yes, perfectly. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record this call for my research? Everything is anonymised, and you can skip any question.
Silvia: Yes, you can record. That is fine.
Anna: Thank you. And just to repeat, you can pause, stop, or skip anything. No consequences. Are there any topics you would prefer not to discuss?
Silvia: Mmm. Not really. Maybe like, very personal family stuff. But career is fine. If I feel uncomfortable, I will tell you.
Anna: Great. And I will use a pseudonym and remove any identifying details. Cool. So I will start with some context questions and then we will go into human coaching and AI tools. Ready?
Silvia: Yes, ready.
Anna: Nice. So first, could you introduce yourself briefly, like age, where you are based, what you do?
Silvia: Sure. I am Silvia, 25. I am Italian. I have been living in Berlin for three years now. I did a Master’s in International Relations. And I work in a climate-tech startup, in partnerships and sales, like business development.
Anna: Great, thank you. And just to ground it, you are currently in Berlin, right?
Silvia: Yes. Neukolln.
Anna: Ok.
Silvia: Like, not the cool part, more the chaotic part. 
Anna: Understood.
Silvia: Berlin is always chaotic anyway.
Anna: True when i was there it was exactly like that. Ok, then let us move to your career situation.
2) Participant context and career situation
Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing, or recently faced?
Silvia: Eehm, so I think I am at this point where I am not a junior anymore, but I also do not feel like a real professional, you know. I have, like, two years of work experience in Berlin, and before that some internships. In my current job I started as like partnerships associate, and now I am like BD manager, but in a startup that title means nothing. It means you do everything.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: And my main question is, I need to sharpen my positioning. Like, what am I, actually. Am I BD, am I product, am I operations. Because in our company, the lines are super blurred. And I feel ambitious, I want to grow, but I also feel insecure because I am not technical enough. And climate-tech is very technical, or at least it can be. So I am trying to figure out where I can be strongest.
Anna: When you say sharpen your positioning, what does that mean for you, concretely?
Silvia: Like, if I need to apply somewhere, or if I want to ask for a different scope internally, I need to say, ok, I am a BD person. Or, no, I am more like product-ish. Or, I am like ops, I make things work. And right now my story is too broad. It is like, I do sales, I do partnerships, I do marketing sometimes, I do a bit of customer success, and then I join product calls and talk about features.
Anna: Mm. So it is not clear what the core is.
Silvia: Exactly. And it sounds nice, but it also sounds like, she is random. Like, she is not deep.
Anna: And what triggered that question recently? Was there a specific moment?
Silvia: Yes. There was like a re-org moment. In December, our founders decided we should focus on enterprise accounts, longer sales cycles, more consultative selling. We are in carbon accounting software, for supply chain emissions, mostly Scope 3. So it is complex. And they said, ok, Silvia, you will own partnerships for DACH and also start leading enterprise outreach for, like, industrial clients.
Anna: That is a big shift.
Silvia: Yes. And it was exciting, because it is like, wow, they trust me. But it also was scary because I was like, I do not speak German perfectly, and also enterprise means you need credibility. Like, you talk to sustainability managers, procurement, sometimes CFO. And then the product is technical, you need to explain methodologies, data integration, APIs, ERP systems. And I was like, hmm, ok, am I the right person. 
Anna: What happened that made you feel not technical enough?
Silvia: There is one moment I remember. We had a customer demo with a logistics company. The head of sustainability asked about how we map emission factors and how we deal with missing supplier data. And then someone from their IT joined and asked about integration with SAP and data security, like where the data is hosted, encryption, access rights.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: And I tried to answer, but I was not sure. I gave like a high-level answer, and then our engineer jumped in, and he was super precise. Like, yes, we use this, we do that, we have a certain architecture. And the vibe changed, you know. It was like, ok, the technical guy is the credible one. And I felt like, I am just the person doing the talking.
Anna: That sounds uncomfortable.
Silvia: Yes. And then after the call, the founder told me, you did well, but you need to be more confident. And I was like, yes, but confidence comes from knowledge. It is not just like, be confident.
Anna: Mm. So your insecurity is tied to competence, not just mindset.
Silvia: Exactly. And also, I think I compare myself to people in Berlin who are like, product managers, ex-consultants, or people from TU Munich, you know, very technical. And I am International Relations. Sometimes I feel like, what am I doing here.
Anna: How do you measure ambition for yourself?
Silvia: Eehm. Good question. I measure it like, I want to have more impact and also more responsibility. I want to lead projects, maybe lead a team. I want to be in rooms where decisions happen. And I also want to earn more, honestly. Berlin is expensive now.
Anna: Sure.
Silvia: And I want to stay in climate-tech because it matters, like, it is not just selling random software. But I also do not want to become like this, how to say, performance machine, where I am always optimizing, always chasing titles.
Anna: So there is tension between ambition and authenticity.
Silvia: Yes. Exactly. Like, I want to win, but I also want to feel like myself. 
Anna: And in terms of your situation in Germany, do you have any visa constraints, or is it straightforward?
Silvia: I am EU, so it is straightforward. That is one privilege. I do not have Blue Card stress. But I have like, life stress. Berlin stress.
Anna: Understood. And your German level?
Silvia: I think B1, maybe low B2 in reading. Speaking is the problem. In meetings I can do some German, but for enterprise sales, it is tough. Sometimes I switch to English, and then the German person switches too, but you feel like, hmm, maybe I am losing something.
Anna: Ok. Thanks. That is helpfut. Let us talk about where you get career support in general.
3) Career support in general
Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Silvia: Eehm. Friends first. Like other internationals in Berlin, people working in startups. Also some Italian friends, because they understand my background. Then sometimes my boyfriend, but he is in tech, so he gives a technical perspective.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: And I also use online resources. Like newsletters, podcasts, LinkedIn posts. Sometimes I talk to people in my network, like informational chats. Berlin is very network-y, you can just DM someone and say, coffee.
Anna: Does that work for you?
Silvia: Sometimes yes. Sometimes it is superficial. Like, people give advice but they do not know your context. So you get very generic things. But the network effect is real. If you meet one person, they introduce you to another, and then you see patterns.
Anna: Any formal services, like university career services or mentors?
Silvia: Not university, because my Master was in Italy and I did not really use career services. In Berlin, I did group coaching, like a program for women in startups. It was paid, but not super expensive.
Anna: Ok.
Silvia: And I sometimes use AI tools. Like ChatGPT. Mostly for work, not for like, should I change my job. More for outreach messages, market research summaries, like competitor mapping.
Anna: What has actually helped you, and what felt unhelpful or frustrating?
Silvia: Helped: talking to peers. Like people one or two steps ahead. They say, this is normal, you are not crazy, and also they share very practical things, like, how they position their role, how they negotiate salary, scripts for difficult conversations. That is super helpful.
Anna: And unhelpful?
Silvia: When advice is too generic. Like, follow your passion. Or be confident. Or, build your personal brand. And you are like, ok, but what do I do on Monday.
Anna: Mm. Thank you. Let us talk about your experience with human coaching, specifically the group coaching you mentioned.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust
Anna: Can you describe that group coaching experience? What was it, and what did it look like in practice?
Silvia: Yes. It was like an eight-week program, once a week, two hours. Zoom. There were maybe twelve women, mostly in startups, roles like marketing, BD, product, operations. The coach was a woman, German, maybe in her 40s, with like coaching certification.
Anna: And what was the goal of the program?
Silvia: It was career clarity and confidence. Like positioning, boundaries, leadership presence. And also peer accountability. We had like homework, journaling prompts, and then we shared in the group.
Anna: What did you like about it?
Silvia: The peer effect. One hundred percent. Like, hearing other women say they feel impostor syndrome, they feel not technical enough, they feel behind. It normalised my feelings. And also, peers had examples. Like one woman was in a climate-tech scaleup, and she explained how BD works there, how they work with product. It was like, wow, ok, there are options.
Anna: Can you share a specific moment where peers helped you?
Silvia: Yes. There was a session on self-advocacy. I shared that our founders want me to do enterprise outreach, but I feel insecure. And I said, I do not know how to ask for support without sounding weak. And then two peers jumped in. One said, you can frame it as, to deliver better results, you need access to technical knowledge, so you propose a weekly session with an engineer to learn the product deeper. And another said, you can ask for a clearer role definition, like, what is success in three months.
Anna: That sounds practical.
Silvia: Yes. And then they even gave me wording. Like, I mean, no wait, let me rephrase. They gave me a script. Like, in German and English. One person said, you can say, I want to take full ownership, and to do that I need these resources. It is not weakness, it is professionalism.
Anna: And did you use that?
Silvia: Yes. I actually did. The next week I spoke with the founder. I said, I want to own enterprise, but I need a technical buddy. And now I have a weekly session with our solutions engineer. It is like thirty minutes. That came from peers, not from the coach.
Anna: Interesting. So the outcome was a concrete change at work.
Silvia: Yes. Exactly.
Anna: And how did the coach contribute?
Silvia: Eehm. She facilitated. She created a safe space. She had some frameworks, like values, strengths, vision. But sometimes it felt generic. Like, she would say, ok, write down your values, and then align your career. And I was like, yes, that is true, but it is also like, ok, I have values, now what.
Anna: Can you remember a moment where the coach felt generic or secondary?
Silvia: Yes. There was one session where I said, I am unsure if I should move toward product or stay in BD. And she said, maybe you can do an ikigai exercise, like what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, what you can be paid for.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: And I was like, ok, yes, but that is like, the internet. And she did not really ask deep questions. It was like, ok, do the exercise, and you will know. But I did the exercise and I still did not know, because I like many things.
Anna: So it was nice but not specific.
Silvia: Exactly. She was kind. She was trustworthy in the sense she was respectful and confidential. But not effective in that moment, because she did not get into my concrete context, like climate-tech BD, technical insecurity, Berlin startup reality.
Anna: That is helpful. You are already distinguishing trust and effectiveness.
Silvia: Yes. Trust was high in terms of safety, but effectiveness was medium.
Anna: Let us unpack trust in human coaching for you. What makes a human coach or a group setting trustworthy?
Silvia: For humans, trust is like, do I feel seen, not judged. Emotional safety. Confidentiality. Also, lived experience matters. Like, if someone has been in a similar role, BD in a technical company, then I trust more. And peer credibility, like hearing from peers who actually do the thing. That was huge.
Anna: So peers were like a credibility source.
Silvia: Yes. Because they do not pretend. They say, I did this, it worked, or it did not. And you believe it because it is messy.
Anna: Anything that reduces trust in human coaching?
Silvia: If it feels like they have a one-size-fits-all method. Or if they push you to conclusions. Or if they do not remember what you said before. Like if I share something vulnerable and next time they forget, I feel like, ok, I am just another client.
Anna: In group coaching, did you worry about confidentiality?
Silvia: A bit, yes. Because you do not know people. But we had rules, like what is said here stays here. And it felt ok. I did not share super sensitive details like salary numbers. But I shared enough.
Anna: And did you feel seen in that group?
Silvia: Yes, by peers. The coach was ok, but peers really saw me. They said, oh, you always downplay your competence. Or, you are always translating technical stuff into human language, that is a skill. And I was like, oh, that is true.
Anna: That is interesting. So trust drivers can come from different actors in a group setting.
Silvia: Exactly.
Anna: Ok. Before we move to AI, I want to capture one more concrete episode. Biggest career decision in the last six to twelve months. What was it?
Silvia: Hmm. I think it was whether to stay in this startup or take a role in a bigger climate-tech company, like a scaleup, where the role is more defined. I got approached by a recruiter in September. It was a partnerships role, but more like account management, less chaotic.
Anna: And what made it difficult?
Silvia: The uncertainty. In Berlin startups, you can grow fast, but you can also burn out. In a bigger company, you learn processes, but you might get stuck. And I also felt like, if I leave now, I am running away from my technical insecurity instead of solving it.
Anna: What did you decide?
Silvia: I stayed. And then the re-org happened, so now it is like, ok, you wanted growth, here it is.
Anna: That is how it goes.
Silvia: Yes.
Anna: Ok. Now let us shift to AI tools.
5) AI tools: experience and trust
Anna: You said you use AI mainly for work, like outreach messages and market research summaries. Can you walk me through how you actually use it?
Silvia: Sure. For outreach, I do cold emails and LinkedIn messages, mostly. Our product is carbon accounting for supply chains. We target sustainability managers, procurement, sometimes operations. And each persona cares about different things.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: So I use AI to draft an initial message, then I customise. I might say, ok, write a LinkedIn message to a head of sustainability in manufacturing, mention recent EU regulations, like CSRD, and connect to Scope 3 reporting, and be friendly but not too salesy.
Anna: And then you edit.
Silvia: Yes. I always edit, because otherwise it is too generic, too enthusiastic, like, hope you are doing great, and I am like, no, Germans do not do that. 
Anna: Fair.
Silvia: And also, I feed it context. Like, I paste their company description, or I summarise their latest sustainability report, and I ask for a message that references something specific. It saves time.
Anna: Any follow-up sequences?
Silvia: Yes. Like, I ask it to propose a three-step follow-up sequence. For example, first message is value proposition, second is a short case study, third is a question. It helps structure.
Anna: And market research summaries?
Silvia: That is also huge. Like, I say, summarise the carbon accounting software landscape in Europe, main competitors, positioning, typical pricing models, and key decision criteria for buyers. Then it gives me a map. But I have to be careful because it sometimes invents things.
Anna: Can you give an example of when it invented things?
Silvia: Yes. It once said a competitor had a partnership with a big consulting firm. And I was like, wow, that is important. Then I searched and it was not true. It was like hallucination. That was a trust hit.
Anna: How did you notice it was wrong?
Silvia: Because I knew the competitor a bit. And also it cited like, sources, but when I checked, the sources were not real. And then I was like, ok, I cannot rely on it for factual market intelligence unless I verify.
Anna: So you have a verification habit.
Silvia: Yes. For market facts, yes. For message drafts, less risky.
Anna: Ok. Tell me about a moment AI helped a lot.
Silvia: One moment was when we were launching a new feature: supplier engagement module. We needed to explain it in a simple way to prospects. I asked AI to help craft a value proposition for three personas: sustainability lead, procurement, and IT. It gave me different angles. For procurement, it focused on supplier compliance and risk. For IT, it focused on integration and data governance. That helped me create a better outreach. And we had better reply rates that week, like, not crazy, but noticeable. I think because messages were more relevant.
Anna: So effectiveness there was in speed and structure and persona adaptation.
Silvia: Exactly. And also, it helps with language. Like, I am Italian, my English is good, but sometimes I want a crisp sentence, and it helps.
Anna: And a moment where AI did not help, apart from hallucinated facts.
Silvia: There was a moment where I asked it to help me position myself. Like, I tried once. I said, I am in climate-tech BD, I am not sure if I am more BD or product. Help me decide.
Anna: And what happened?
Silvia: It gave me a very structured answer. Like, here are pros and cons, here is a decision matrix, here are steps. And it felt impressive, like, wow. But I also felt like, it is pushing me into optimization mode. Like, choose the best option, maximise. And I was like, but I do not want to optimise. I want to know what I actually want.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: And then I felt anxious. Because it was like, ok, do these ten steps, build a portfolio, talk to five people, do a SWOT. And I was like, oh my god, more tasks.
Anna: So it increased the pressure.
Silvia: Yes. And also it did not know me. It did not ask about my values in a deep way. It was like, do a values exercise, which is again generic. So I stopped. For personal decisions, I avoid AI. Because I fear it will push me into being a productivity robot, not a human.
Anna: That is an important boundary.
Silvia: Yes. I use it for external-facing tasks. Messages, summaries. But not for, who am I.
Anna: You also mentioned that wanting question, like what you truly want, feels more suitable for a psychologist or coach, or something you figure out yourself.
Silvia: Yes. Exactly. Because wanting is emotional, messy. AI is too clean. It gives you an answer, but maybe it is not your answer. It is like, it can be effective in output, but not authentic.
Anna: That is a good phrase. Effective output but not authentic.
Silvia: Yes.
Anna: Let us talk specifically about trust in AI. What drives trust for you, and what reduces it?
Silvia: Trust drivers: speed. It is always there. Structure. It can take messy information and create a clean outline. And for outreach, it can generate variants fast, which feels like, ok, I can iterate.
Anna: And what reduces trust?
Silvia: When it invents facts. When it sounds too confident. Also privacy, but for me less, because I do not put very sensitive things. But still, I do not put internal numbers. And the other thing is, it can lead to sameness. Like, if everyone uses it, everyone writes the same messages.
Anna: So you fear losing uniqueness.
Silvia: Yes. And losing my voice. That is like an emotional trust issue. Like, can I trust it to represent me.
Anna: That is a different trust dimension than factual accuracy.
Silvia: Exactly.
Anna: Ok. Now I want to compare human and AI via specific tasks. But before that, we will embed some micro-poll ratings. It will be quick. Is that ok?
Silvia: Yes.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks
Anna: I will ask you to rate from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is complete trust. First: your trust in human career coaches, based on your experience, including the group coaching nuance.
Silvia: Hmm. I would say, maybe 7.
Anna: 7. Why 7, not higher or lower?
Silvia: Higher because I can feel safe, like confidentiality, being heard. And in group coaching, peers add credibility. Lower because the coach can be generic, and also, I have not had like one-on-one coaching with someone who really knows my domain. If I had a coach who did climate-tech BD, maybe it would be 9.
Anna: Ok. Next your trust in AI tools for career-related support, 0 to 10.
Silvia: For career-related, like decisions, I would say 4. For work tasks, maybe 8, but you asked career support, so 4.
Anna: 4. What drives that?
Silvia: I trust it to generate structure and drafts, but I do not trust it with my identity questions. And I do not trust it with facts unless I verify. So overall, 4.
Anna: Next: perceived effectiveness of human coaching for your situation, 0 to 10.
Silvia: Hmm. Maybe 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Silvia: Because it helped through peers, accountability, and I made a concrete change at work. But the coach itself was not super effective. And group coaching is not personalised. So 6.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10.
Silvia: For my situation, I think 7. But again, not for personal decisions, more for tasks. So maybe 7.
Anna: Interesting. So AI effectiveness higher than AI trust.
Silvia: Yes. Because it can produce a strong message, like objectively effective, but I might not trust it emotionally. Or I feel it is not me.
Anna: That is exactly the distinction we are exploring. Ok, thanks. Now we will go deeper with tasks. I will name a task and you tell me which you prefer, human or AI, and why.
Silvia: Ok.
Anna: Task one: drafting outreach messages to prospects. Human coach, peer, or AI?
Silvia: AI. Definitely AI.
Anna: Why?
Silvia: Speed. And you can do variants. And it is not emotionally risky. If AI gives me a bad message, I just change it. Also, a human coach would be too slow and expensive for that.
Anna: And what would make AI more trustworthy for outreach?
Silvia: If I can control the tone. Like, prompt it with my style and constraints. And if it does not make wrong assumptions about the prospect. Sometimes it assumes they care about something they do not.
Anna: Can you give a concrete example?
Silvia: Yes. I once asked it to write a message to a procurement lead. It said, you are probably under pressure to comply with CSRD. But procurement is not directly responsible. So it was like, slightly wrong. Then the message feels off.
Anna: Ok. Task two: summarising a market or competitor landscape.
Silvia: AI, but with verification. Like, I use it as a starting point, but then I check.
Anna: What do you check?
Silvia: Competitor names, features, pricing, partnerships, any claims. I cross-check with websites, news, sometimes G2 reviews.
Anna: Task three: preparing for a difficult conversation with your founder about your scope, like BD vs product vs operations.
Silvia: Hmm. That is more human. Or peers.
Anna: Why?
Silvia: Because it is emotional and political. AI can give me scripts, but it cannot read the room. Peers can tell you, watch out, the founder will react like this, or the culture is like that.
Anna: Does AI help at all there?
Silvia: Maybe for structuring my points. Like, ok, list what I want, list what I offer, list what support I need. But I do not want it to tell me what I should want.
Anna: Task four: clarifying what you want long term, like the wanting question.
Silvia: Human. Or myself.
Anna: What kind of human, specifically? Coach, therapist, mentor, friend?
Silvia: Eehm. I think a coach or therapist. Coach for career structure, therapist for deeper patterns. Friends also help, but they are biased. A coach at least is neutral. But the coach needs to be good.
Anna: What is good?
Silvia: Someone who asks real questions, not frameworks. Someone who can hold silence. And who can challenge me gently. And ideally someone who understands startup roles.
Anna: Ok. Task five: building confidence in technical meetings.
Silvia: That is tricky. I think human plus practice. AI can help me learn concepts, like explain what Scope 3 is, or explain what an API is, but confidence comes from using it.
Anna: So AI can support learning.
Silvia: Yes. Like, I ask it, explain SAP integration like I am five. That helps. But then in a meeting, you need to speak.
Anna: Task six: writing a personal narrative for LinkedIn or for interviews, like your positioning.
Silvia: Hmm. Hybrid. AI can help with drafts and structure. Human can help with authenticity and truth.
Anna: That is a good segue into trust and effectiveness. Let us go there.
7) Trust–effectiveness link
Anna: When you think about your experiences, how does trust affect whether support is effective, for humans and for AI?
Silvia: For humans, trust is like the condition for depth. If I trust the coach, I share the real insecurity. Like, I say, I feel stupid in technical meetings. If I do not trust, I will say something superficial, like, I want to grow. Then the coaching is superficial, and effectiveness is low.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: And in the group, trust was created by rules and by seeing others be vulnerable. Then I felt, ok, I can share. That made it effective because peers gave real advice.
Anna: So trust enabled effectiveness.
Silvia: Yes, for humans. For AI, it is different. Trust is not needed for it to produce an effective output. Like, it can write a strong message even if I do not trust it. But then, whether it is effective for me depends on whether I use it and whether it aligns with me.
Anna: Can you give an example of effective but not trusted?
Silvia: Yes. I had one outreach message it generated that was really good. Very crisp, very relevant, and it got a reply. But I felt weird, like, is this my voice. It felt slightly manipulative, like too polished. And I was like, ok, it works, but I do not trust it to represent my values. So it was effective in outcome, but not trusted.
Anna: That is very clear. And the other direction: trusted but not effective.
Silvia: That is the coach moment. She was nice, safe, I trusted her as a person, but her advice was generic. Like, do ikigai. So I trusted her, but it did not move me.
Anna: If you think about effectiveness indicators for you, what counts as effective support?
Silvia: Clearer narrative. Like, I can say what I do and why it matters. Confidence in meetings. Concrete experiments, like trying a project with product, or setting boundaries with founders. Better outreach results, like reply rate, meeting booked. Clearer boundaries, like what I will not do. And reduced anxiety. Like, sleeping better.
Anna: And how do trust and effectiveness interact in your day-to-day?
Silvia: With AI, I use it because it is effective for tasks, even if trust is partial. With humans, if trust is not there, I do not use it, so effectiveness cannot happen. So trust is like a gate for humans. For AI, trust is like a filter, not a gate.
Anna: Oh wow.
Silvia: Yes. Because I can still use AI pragmatically, like a tool, without trusting it emotionally. But for a coach, you cannot.
Anna: Ok. If you look at your earlier ratings, human trust 7, human effectiveness 6, AI trust 4, AI effectiveness 7. Does that pattern make sense to you now?
Silvia: Yes. It makes sense. Because humans are more trustworthy emotionally, but not always effective practically. AI is effective practically, but not trustworthy for identity.
Anna: In your opinion, what would increase trust in AI for career decisions?
Silvia: Hmm. That is hard. Maybe if it had boundaries, like it clearly says, I am not here to tell you what to want. I can help you explore options. Also, if it asked better questions, not just give answers. And if it was more transparent, like, why it suggests something.
Anna: So a more Socratic approach.
Silvia: Yes. And maybe if it was integrated with a human, so you do not feel alone with it.
Anna: Ok. That brings us to preferences and hybrid models.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction
Anna: Imagine a hybrid model: AI helps you prepare, structure, draft, and explore options, and then a human coach or mentor steps in for high-stakes decisions, values, and accountability. How does that sound to you?
Silvia: That sounds good. That is like, the ideal.
Anna: What feels good about it?
Silvia: Because it matches how I already behave. I use AI for fast tasks and structure. Then I go to peers for real talk. If a platform made that seamless, it would reduce friction.
Anna: What would make you sceptical?
Silvia: If it is not clear when AI stops and human starts. Like, if they pretend AI is a coach. That would annoy me. Also, privacy. If my AI chat is shared with a human without my control, I would not like that. And also, I fear the hybrid could still push me into optimization. Like, you do AI exercises, you get tasks, you become like, more productive, but not necessarily happier.
Anna: So you want it to support choice, not optimisation.
Silvia: Yes. Choice and clarity. Not hustle.
Anna: If you could design your ideal hybrid journey for your current question, BD vs product vs ops, what would it look like?
Silvia: Eehm. First, AI helps me map the roles. Like, what does BD look like in climate-tech, what does product look like, what does ops look like, day-to-day, success metrics, typical career paths.
Anna: Ok.
Silvia: Then AI helps me list my experiences and translate them into skills. Like, I already do some product discovery because I talk to customers, I translate feedback to engineers. That could be product. Or I coordinate partnerships, that is ops.
Anna: Mm.
Silvia: Then, with a human, I would talk about what I enjoy, what drains me, what I want to become. And also, the human can challenge my insecurity, like, are you really not technical enough, or are you just comparing yourself.
Anna: Would you prefer one-on-one or group?
Silvia: For this, one-on-one. Group is good for normalising, but for a decision, I want personal attention.
Anna: What kind of person would you trust most as a human in that hybrid?
Silvia: Someone who did BD or product in a technical startup. Ideally climate-tech, but at least B2B SaaS. And someone who understands Berlin culture, like ambiguity. And someone who does not judge my background. Like, International Relations is not a weakness.
Anna: And how would you want AI positioned in that model? As a tool, as a coach, as a copilot?
Silvia: Tool or copilot. Not coach. Coach implies emotional guidance. Copilot is like, you still fly the plane.
Anna: Nice. Any concerns about reliance, like overusing AI?
Silvia: Yes. I can see myself going into a loop. Like, prompt, refine, prompt, refine. It feels productive, but you are not deciding. So the system should maybe limit it or encourage reflection.
Anna: Encourage reflection how?
Silvia: Like, after giving options, ask, which one feels energising. Or, what do you fear. But not in a fake way. And maybe it should say, stop now and talk to a human.
Anna: So nudges.
Silvia: Yes. But not too paternalistic. Berlin people hate being told what to do. 
Anna: Fair.
Silvia: We are all like, do not control me. But also, please help me. 
Anna: That is very Berlin.
Silvia: Yes.
Anna: If you think about trust in a hybrid model, what are the key trust conditions?
Silvia: For AI part: transparency, boundaries, no hallucinations, and control over my data. For human part: confidentiality, being seen, and domain credibility. And also, a clear explanation of how the human is chosen, like matching logic. If it is random, I would not trust.
Anna: Ok. If you had to summarise your preference in one sentence, what would it be?
Silvia: AI for execution and structure, humans for meaning and courage.
Anna: Meaning and courage. Woah.
Silvia: Because decisions need courage. And courage comes from feeling supported, not from a perfect spreadsheet.
Anna: Mm. Ok. We are close to closing. I will ask a couple of final questions.
9) Closing
Anna: Looking forward, what is one concrete next step you want to take in the next month regarding your positioning question?
Silvia: I want to do a small experiment. Like, I want to take ownership of a product-related project. We have a feature request pipeline, and I want to lead one initiative from customer insight to shipping, with product and engineering. Just one.
Anna: That would give you information.
Silvia: Yes. It will show if I like product work, or if I hate it. And also, it will increase my technical confidence because I will work closer with engineers.
Anna: What support do you need to do that?
Silvia: Time and permission. And someone to mentor me, like the product lead. And I need to manage my own anxiety, like, not thinking I am stupid.
Anna: If you had a good coaching support, human or hybrid, what would success look like after, say, three months?
Silvia: I would have a clear narrative: I am a BD person with product mindset, or I am transitioning to product, or I am ops. And I would feel calmer. Like, ok, I am not behind. I am on a path. And I would feel more confident in technical meetings, like I can ask questions without shame.
Anna: Anything else you want to add that we did not cover?
Silvia: Maybe one thing. In climate-tech, there is also this moral pressure. Like, you want to do good, and sometimes you feel guilty if you focus on career and money. And coaching that ignores that feels incomplete. AI also ignores that. It is like, optimise your career. But in climate-tech, you also want alignment with values.
Anna: Thank you. So the value layer matters.
Silvia: Yes. Because otherwise you can become cynical. And then you leave climate-tech.
Anna: Ok. Thank you, Silvia. That was very good to talk to you. I will stop the recording now. Thanks again for your time.
Silvia: Thank you. It was actually nice to talk. And good luck with your thesis.
Anna: Thank you so much. Bye.
Silvia: Ciao.










Mihir
1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Mihir. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything is anonymous, and you can skip any question.
Mihir: Hi Anna. Yes, you can record. That is okay.
Anna: Thank you. And just to confirm, you are comfortable with this being used for a research thesis, anonymized, no real names, no company names?
Mihir: Yes, that is fine. I will also try not to mention my company name.
Anna: Perfect. If anything slips out, I will remove it in transcription. One more thing, if at any point you want to pause or stop, just tell me. Okay?
Mihir: Okay.
Anna: Great. We will talk about your experiences with career support from humans and from AI tools, and how you think about trust and effectiveness. No right or wrong answers. I will ask a main question, and sometimes follow up. Ready?
Mihir: Yes, ready. A bit nervous, but ready.
Anna: Totally fine. We can go step by step.
2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: To start, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now?
Mihir: Um, okay. So I am 26. I am from India. I have been in Germany for, like, two and a half years now. I am based in Munich. I am doing my Master’s in Electrical Engineering, but with a track in embedded systems and robotics, like more software plus hardware. I am also working as a working student in a startup.
Anna: Mm. And when you say career decisions or questions, what is the biggest one for you right now?
Mihir: The biggest is, what role do I actually want and can I get in Germany. Because I feel I am doing many things. At the startup I do embedded stuff, some firmware, sometimes testing, sometimes a bit of data logging and like Python scripts. But I do not know if I should aim for embedded software engineer, or robotics engineer, or maybe something like systems engineer. And then also the whole German job market has these titles, like Entwicklungsingenieur, Softwareentwickler, Systemingenieur, and they all sound similar but then requirements are different. So, eehm, I am confused.
Anna: When did that confusion become more intense? Was there a moment in the last months?
Mihir: Yes. Actually last summer, like around June or July 2025, I had to decide about my thesis topic and also whether to extend my working student contract. My startup wanted me to stay, but it is a bit, how to say, unclear. Like I learn a lot, but I do not know if it is the right brand for my CV. And then my university supervisor was like, pick a thesis that matches your target job. And then I was like, but I do not know the target job. So it became a loop.
Anna: A loop, yes. What did you decide in the end?
Mihir: In the end, I chose a thesis topic that is kind of in the middle. It is about real-time sensor data processing on microcontrollers, with some edge AI concepts, but not too heavy. My thinking was, okay, embedded plus some ML buzzword helps. But then I also feel, maybe I am doing it for the job market, not because I love it. And then I feel guilty. It is a lot.
Anna: When you say you feel guilty, can you say more? Guilty about what?
Mihir: Guilty because I feel I am not having a clear passion. Like in India, also with my family, it is like you choose a track and you become that. Here I see people very focused. Like, my classmates, some are like, I am robotics, I do ROS2, I build robots, that is it. Some are like, I am power electronics, I do SiC, that is it. And I am like, I can do many things but I cannot say one sentence what I am. And then on LinkedIn everyone is like, I joined this company as full-time, I got Blue Card, I bought a car, whatever. And I am still studying. And I am 26. And in my head it is like, bro, what are you doing. It makes me very low sometimes.
Anna: Thanks for sharing that. When you feel low, what does that look like day to day?
Mihir: Um. I sleep late because I overthink. Then in the morning I am tired. I still go to work because I have to. And then I do okay at work, because tasks are clear. But when it is about future, like applying, planning, then I freeze. And sometimes I just scroll job ads and then I get more stressed. Or I compare salaries. Or I watch videos like, how to get a job in Germany as international student. And then it is too much. It is not like I cannot function, but it feels heavy. Like a constant pressure.
Anna: That pressure, is it mainly about time, money, visa, or identity, or all of it?
Mihir: All. Money because Munich is expensive. I share a WG. Rent is crazy. Visa because I have student visa. I know after graduation I can get job-seeker, and then Blue Card path, but it still feels like a ticking thing. Also identity because I feel, I came here to build something. I wanted a proper career. And I am still not there.
Anna: What is your German level right now?
Mihir: Like B2 maybe. I can do daily things. I can speak in supermarket, Bürgerbüro, but job interviews in German, no. And job ads are sometimes in German. Or mixed. So I use AI to translate and explain. That is a big part.
Anna: We will go deeper into that later. Before that, tell me a bit about your working student role. What kind of startup is it, and what do you actually do there?
Mihir: Okay. It is a small startup, maybe 25 people. They build a hardware product for industrial monitoring. Like sensors plus edge device. I am in the engineering team. My tasks, for example, one month I worked on firmware for a microcontroller to handle SPI communication with a sensor. Then we had issues with timing, so I had to debug with logic analyzer. Then I also wrote a small Python tool to parse logs and produce graphs, like check packet loss. Sometimes I also support QA by writing test scripts. So it is many hats.
Anna: And how do you feel about that?
Mihir: Mixed. On one side, I love that I learn. Like it is hands-on. It is not like only theory. On the other side, when I try to write my CV, it becomes messy. Because the job ad wants, like, embedded C, RTOS, communication protocols, but also wants requirements engineering, or wants safety standards, or wants AUTOSAR. And I am like, I did a bit of everything, but not deep in those. And then I think, am I behind.
Anna: You said you sometimes use AI for confidence-building, like am I behind. Is that connected to this?
Mihir: Yes. Very connected. Because when I see job ads, I feel not enough. And then I ask AI, like, if I have these skills, is it normal, am I behind, what can I do in 3 months. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it makes it worse.
Anna: Okay. We will come back. One last thing in this section. What kind of plan do you imagine would calm you? If you picture an ideal structured plan, what is in it?
Mihir: Hmm. Like a timeline. Like, okay, next 8 weeks, do this project, update CV, apply to 10 roles per week, practice interviews twice a week, learn German one hour per day. And also milestones, like by March, have one strong portfolio project, by April, have 5 interviews, by May, finish thesis. Something like that. And also decision points, like if embedded roles are not working, then pivot to data engineering or something. But with logic, not just random.
Anna: Aha. Got it.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Mihir: First, my friends. Mostly Indian friends also in Munich. We are all like in the same boat. And sometimes German classmates. But with Germans I feel, they are kind, but they do not fully understand visa pressure, you know. Then I also talk to my girlfriend in India, on video call. She is supportive, but she cannot help with Germany specifics. And then I use online resources, like YouTube, LinkedIn posts, sometimes Reddit, but it is too much noise. And I use AI tools, like ChatGPT, also sometimes Gemini, but mostly ChatGPT.
Anna: Any university career services?
Mihir: I tried one workshop at university. It was okay, like basic, how to structure CV, what is Anschreiben, things like that. But it was very general. And also mostly in German. So I felt, okay, nice, but not enough.
Anna: What has actually helped you, and what felt unhelpful or frustrating?
Mihir: Helpful is when someone tells me concrete reality. Like, in Germany they like this format, like this evidence, they ask this in interviews, like they want projects. Also helpful is when someone reads my CV and says, this is confusing, cut this. Unhelpful is generic motivation. Like, keep going, you will be fine. Because I know they mean well, but it does not reduce my uncertainty. It is like a band-aid.
Anna: Can you give me an example of high support but not effective? Like someone you trust, but it did not help?
Mihir: Yes. My close friend here, he is like my brother. He listens. He tells me, you are smart, you will get job, do not worry. And I trust him, like emotionally. But after talking, I still do not know what to do next. So I feel supported, but not effective. And then sometimes I feel worse because I wasted time talking instead of doing. But also, I need that sometimes. So it is complicated.
Anna: That is really clear. Supportive but not directional.
Mihir: Yes, exactly.
Anna: And in terms of paid support, have you ever tried a paid career coach?
Mihir: No. I have not. I thought about it, but I have no idea where to find the right one. And I also worry about money and scams. Like, there are many coaches on Instagram or LinkedIn. Everyone is a coach. How to know who is legit. And also, I feel I need it urgently, but I do not know how to choose.
Anna: When you say urgently, what makes it urgent right now?
Mihir: Because I feel time is running. I am 26, still student. I moved from role to role. In India I did internship, then I worked one year, then I came to Germany, then I did working student. So it feels like I am always junior. I want to finally start a real career, like a full-time role with a plan. And also visa and money. So I feel urgency.
Anna: Okay.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust

Anna: You mentioned you had a mentor via a student association. Can you tell me about that experience? How did you meet, and what was the context?
Mihir: Yes. So there is a student association in Munich, like for international students in engineering. They have mentorship program. I joined because a friend told me. It was like, you fill a form, they match you with a mentor. My mentor was an Indian guy, but he has been in Germany for, like, 10 years. He works at a big automotive supplier as embedded engineer. So he knows the system.
Anna: How did the first meeting go?
Mihir: We met in a cafe near Sendlinger Tor. It was very Munich. He was like, okay, tell me your story. And I started talking, very messy. Like, I did this, then that, then Germany. And he listened. And then he asked very structured questions. Like, what do you want, what are your constraints, what do you enjoy, what are your strengths. And then he also explained how hiring works in Germany. That was the big value.
Anna: What did he explain that was new for you?
Mihir: Many things. Like, he said in Germany, HR screens first, they look for keywords, but also they look for stability. They do not like too chaotic story. He said, your CV must show a narrative. He also explained that for embedded roles, you need to show you worked close to hardware, not only Python. And he explained Blue Card basics. Like, he said do not panic, but you need a salary threshold and a degree. He said also, in interviews they will ask about your projects in detail, and they want you to explain your decisions, not just list tools.
Anna: Do you remember a specific moment in that conversation that changed something for you?
Mihir: Yes. He looked at my CV and he said, your CV is like a shopping list. He said, you wrote everything you touched, but you did not write what you achieved. And he took one bullet, like I wrote, implemented firmware in C. He said, no, write, implemented firmware module for sensor communication, reduced latency, improved stability, something like that. And then he asked me, did it improve anything? And I was like, I do not know, it just worked. And he said, go back, measure, or at least describe impact. That was like, okay, German style. Evidence.
Anna: What made you trust him?
Mihir: Hmm. Competence, first. He clearly knew the market. He used German terms, like he talked about Tarif, about Betriebsrat, about what working student means, like Werkstudent, and he understood. Second, he was honest. He did not sugarcoat. He said, Munich is competitive, do not apply randomly. Third, he understood international student constraints. He knew visa, language anxiety. And also he was respectful. Like, he did not judge me for being confused. So I felt safe.
Anna: Did you feel confidentiality with him? Like you could share things?
Mihir: Yes, because it was one-on-one and he also said, whatever we discuss stays here. It was informal but he said it. So I felt okay to say I am stressed.
Anna: After that mentor meeting, what changed in your behavior?
Mihir: I changed my CV format. I made it one page, more focused. I made sections like projects, skills, and I removed many random things. I also started tracking applications in a spreadsheet, like he suggested. And I started preparing for interviews by doing STAR method. He told me about that. So I had more structure.
Anna: Did it solve the confusion about which role fits you?
Mihir: Not fully. It helped me understand the process. But role identity is still open. He gave some suggestions, like, based on my interest, embedded software is good, but he also said, do not chase buzzwords. But I still feel uncertain.
Anna: That is interesting. So high trust, and useful, but not fully effective for the deeper question.
Mihir: Yes. Exactly. Because he was one person, and also he has his own bias. He is in automotive. He thinks embedded is the best. Maybe he is right, but maybe not for me.
Anna: If you imagine a paid career coach, what would you expect from them that your mentor did not provide?
Mihir: I expect more systematic. Like not only one meeting. I want a process. Like first, assess my strengths, values, constraints. Then explore roles. Then choose direction. Then make plan, with weekly check-ins. And accountability. And also someone who knows the German market but also can understand international student reality. And also, I want them to push me, not only comfort me. Like, you said you will apply to 10 jobs, did you do it. But in a kind way.
Anna: What would make you trust a paid coach?
Mihir: Hmm. Proof of competence, like their background. Maybe they worked in hiring or in industry. Also testimonials, but that can be fake. Maybe if they understand my context quickly, like they ask good questions. Also transparency, like what they can and cannot do. And confidentiality. And also, realistic guidance. Like not, you will get job in 2 weeks. That would make me distrust.
Anna: Have you had any interactions with someone who claimed to be a coach, and it felt off?
Mihir: Yes, on LinkedIn. Someone messaged, like, I can help you get job in Germany, pay me 500 euros, I will rewrite your CV. It felt like spam. He did not ask anything about me. So I ignored.
Anna: So for you, trust is tied to personalization and realism.
Mihir: Yes.
Anna: Okay.
5) AI tools: experience and trust

Anna: Now let us talk about AI tools. You said you use AI for learning, debugging, and explaining German job ads. Can you tell me about the first time you used AI for a career-related thing?
Mihir: I think first time was in 2023, when I came to Germany. I was applying for working student roles. I saw job ads in German. Like, they had many words I did not understand. Like, Kenntnisse in, Erfahrung mit, wünschenswert, Vorteil, and all these. So I copied the job ad into ChatGPT and I asked, explain this in English and tell me what are must-have and nice-to-have. And it gave me a structured breakdown. That was very helpful.
Anna: Can you give me a vivid example, like a specific job ad or requirement where it helped you decode expectations?
Mihir: Yes. There was one job ad for Embedded Software Working Student. It said something like, Erfahrung in hardwarenaher Programmierung, Kenntnisse in Echtzeitbetriebssystemen, gute Deutschkenntnisse wünschenswert, and then it had like, CAN, LIN, SPI, I2C. I was like, okay, I know SPI, I2C, a bit of CAN from university, but not deep. And German part made me panic. So AI explained, hardwarenah means close to hardware, real-time OS is like FreeRTOS, and wünschenswert means desirable but not mandatory. It also told me, highlight SPI and I2C projects, and for German, mention that you are learning and comfortable in English. That reduced stress.
Anna: So speed and translation reduced anxiety.
Mihir: Yes, because it made it clear. Like, okay, I do not need to be perfect German. At least for working student, maybe English okay.
Anna: What about using AI for learning and debugging in your technical work?
Mihir: That is daily. Like, I am working with C on microcontrollers. Sometimes there is a bug, like a pointer issue, or timing issue. I paste a simplified code snippet, and ask, what could cause this behavior. It gives ideas. Or for Python scripts, it helps me fix errors fast. Also for concepts, like interrupts, DMA, concurrency, it explains in simple terms. I use it like a tutor. And I trust it more there, because I can test the output. If it says something wrong, I will see.
Anna: So you can verify.
Mihir: Yes. In career advice, it is harder to verify.
Anna: You also mentioned you sometimes use AI for confidence-building, like am I behind. Can you describe a moment when you did that?
Mihir: Yes. One night, I was scrolling LinkedIn. I saw someone from my university, same age, got a full-time role at a big company. And then I felt like, I am failing. So I opened AI and I wrote like, I am 26, still studying, is it too late, am I behind compared to others in Germany. And AI replied like, no, everyone has different path, it is normal, you have international experience, do not compare. It felt good for 5 minutes. But then it felt generic. Like a fortune cookie.
Anna: Did it help in any practical way?
Mihir: Not really. It calmed me, but not grounded. Then I asked, okay, give me a plan. And it gave a plan, but it was too optimistic. Like, apply to 50 jobs per week, build two projects, learn German to B2 in 2 months. And then I felt worse because it was unrealistic. So sometimes AI increases anxiety.
Anna: That is a really concrete example. What do you think made that plan feel untrustworthy?
Mihir: Because it did not consider my actual time. I have thesis, work, cooking, life. It was like, just do everything. Also, it did not ask me questions first. It assumed. And it gave too many options. Like, you can be embedded, you can be data, you can be product, you can do PhD. And I was like, no, I need fewer options, not more.
Anna: So for trust in AI, speed and availability are positives, but accuracy and fit to your context are concerns.
Mihir: Yes.
Anna: Are there moments where you do not trust AI, but you still use it because it is useful?
Mihir: Yes. For example, CV templates. Sometimes I ask AI to rewrite a bullet point. I do not fully trust it because it can exaggerate or use fake metrics. But it still gives a good structure. Like it transforms boring sentence into impact format. Then I edit. So low trust but still useful.
Anna: That is a good separation. You do not fully trust the content, but you trust the format help.
Mihir: Exactly.
Anna: What are your trust drivers for AI specifically? If you list them.
Mihir: Speed. Availability at night. Ability to explain and translate. Also, it is non-judgmental. Like, I can ask stupid questions. And it can structure information. Like it can turn a mess into bullets.
Anna: And what reduces trust?
Mihir: Hallucinations. Like sometimes it says things with confidence that are wrong. Also generic advice. Also privacy, like if I paste my CV with personal data. I try to remove, but still. And also emotional flattening. Like it responds like a bot, even if it is trying to be nice. It does not feel like real understanding.
Anna: When you say hallucinations, have you caught a specific one?
Mihir: Yes. One time I asked about Blue Card requirements. It gave salary threshold numbers, but they were inconsistent. Like one message said one number, then later another. Then I checked other sources and it was confusing. So I realized I cannot rely on it for legal stuff. I can use it to understand concept, but not exact.
Anna: Okay.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: Now I want to compare human support and AI support through specific tasks. I will name a task, and you tell me what you would prefer and why. First task clarifying career options, like what roles exist and which fits you.
Mihir: For options, I use AI first. Because it can list many roles and explain. Like, difference between embedded engineer and firmware engineer and systems engineer. That is helpful. But then I need a human to narrow down based on me. Because AI can list, but it does not know my personality. A human can ask, what do you enjoy, do you like working alone, do you like debugging, do you like customers, and then guide.
Anna: Second task making a decision, like choosing a direction for the next year.
Mihir: Human. Because decision is emotional and also has risk. I want someone to challenge me and also understand my constraints. AI can give pros and cons, but it feels like a spreadsheet. Human can see my fear and maybe call it out.
Anna: Third task: planning concrete next steps, like a weekly plan, checklists, milestones.
Mihir: This is interesting. I think AI can draft a plan fast. Like, it can give a template, weekly schedule, application pipeline. But I need human to make it realistic and hold me accountable. Because AI will not check if I did it. Also human can adjust based on real life.
Anna: Fourth task rewriting CV and cover letters.
Mihir: AI is strong for language and structure. But human is better for truth and positioning. Like, AI can make it sound good, but sometimes too generic. A human who knows German hiring can say, this is not credible, or this story is confusing. Also mentor can say, do not write this because Germans interpret it differently.
Anna: Fifth task preparing for interviews.
Mihir: Both. AI can simulate questions, like give me typical embedded interview questions, and I can practice. It can also help me structure answers. Human is better for feedback on my communication, like how I sound, my confidence, and also the cultural part. Like in Germany they want concise answers, not too much self-promotion but also not too shy. A human can tell me.
Anna: Sixth task emotional support, like when you feel behind.
Mihir: Human. Even if it is not effective in plan, it is real. AI can give reassurance, but it feels hollow. But also, sometimes I do not want to burden friends, so I use AI for venting. It is like, okay, at least something. But not the same.
Anna: That is very nuanced. You are using both, but for different functions.
Mihir: Yes. And also because human costs money and time. AI is free and instant. That matters.
Anna: Can you describe a specific episode where AI helped you in a technical or career task more than a human could at that moment?
Mihir: Yes. At work, we had a bug in firmware. It was like, sometimes sensor read fails. My colleague was busy. I asked AI, and it suggested that I should check if the chip select timing is correct and if there is a race condition with interrupt. It gave me a checklist. I tested, and actually there was an interrupt that was messing the timing. So AI helped me faster than waiting for colleague. That felt very effective. And trust was okay because I verified.
Anna: And a specific episode where a human helped more than AI?
Mihir: The mentor meeting, definitely. Because he understood my whole context. He told me realistic steps. And also he gave me confidence grounded in experience. Like, he said, I have seen many people like you, it works, but you must focus. That felt different than AI saying, you can do anything.
Anna: And an episode where AI increased anxiety?
Mihir: The night with the plan. Also sometimes when I ask, what is best career for me, it gives too many options and I spiral. It is like opening 20 tabs.
Anna: And an episode where a human was kind but not effective?
Mihir: My friend I mentioned. Also my mom. She is like, beta, do not worry, everything will be fine, just study. In Hindi she says, sabbbbbb jhe. It is sweet. But it does not help with Germany job market. 
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about human mentoring or coaching, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Mihir: Trust is like, it decides how honest I can be. If I do not trust, I will only show the nice story. Like, I will say, I am fine, I just want CV tips. But the real issue is, I am scared and confused. If I trust, I can say, I feel behind, I do not know my direction, I am panicking. Then the person can help with the real problem. Also, if I trust their competence, I will follow their advice. If I doubt, I will not act. So trust affects action.
Anna: What are the main drivers of trust for you in a human mentor or coach?
Mihir: Competence, like they know German hiring, they know engineering roles. Empathy, but not pity. Understanding international constraints, like visa, language, working student. Confidentiality. Structure, like they have a process, not random talking. And also feeling seen, like they remember details, they connect patterns. Like, if I say, I always avoid applying, they notice avoidance and help.
Anna: And for AI, how does trust affect effectiveness?
Mihir: For AI, trust is more like, do I believe the information is correct and relevant. If I trust it is accurate, it is effective. If I suspect it is hallucinating, I will double-check and then it is less effective because it adds work. But sometimes even if I do not trust fully, it can still be effective as a tool, like templates. So effectiveness can happen with partial trust. But for deep decisions, low trust means I will not rely on it. I will only use it as a brainstorming tool.
Anna: You just said something important. Sometimes low trust, still useful. Can you explain that with one more example?
Mihir: Yes. Cover letters in German. My German is not enough. So I ask AI to draft an Anschreiben. I do not trust the exact wording because it can sound too formal or weird. But it gives me a base. Then I edit with my friend who knows German better. So I use it despite low trust.
Anna: And opposite direction, high trust but not effective. We talked about supportive friends. Is there any case where you trusted a mentor or human, but it did not lead to results?
Mihir: Hmm. Actually yes. After my mentor meeting, I felt high trust. But I did not follow everything. Like, he told me to apply regularly and track. I did for two weeks, then thesis got heavy, I stopped. So effectiveness was limited not because his advice was bad, but because I did not implement. And also because he was not there to follow up. So trust was high, but outcome not fully.
Anna: So there is also an accountability component.
Mihir: Yes. Trust alone is not enough. I need structure and accountability. That is why I think a paid coach could help, if they do weekly check-ins.
Anna: If we separate trust and effectiveness, how do you personally define effectiveness in career support? What are your indicators?
Mihir: Effectiveness is when after the support, I have clarity and next steps. Like, I know what role I am targeting, what companies, what skills to highlight. Also my applications become stronger, like more interviews. Interview performance improves, like I answer better. And also reduced overwhelm. Like I feel calm because I know what to do. And confidence grounded in evidence, like not just feeling good, but actually seeing progress.
Anna: You mentioned reduced overwhelm. What reduces overwhelm for you concretely?
Mihir: Checklists. Like, today do this. And also having fewer decisions. If someone says, for next month, focus only on embedded roles, do not also apply to data. That reduces overwhelm. And also a timeline. If I see, okay, thesis ends May, apply from March, interview April, then I feel less panic.
Anna: Great.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction

Anna: I want to embed a quick micro-poll now. I will ask you to rate from 0 to 10. Zero means no trust or not effective at all, ten means fully trust or extremely effective. And then you explain. Okay?
Mihir: Okay.
Anna: First, trust in human coaches or mentors for career guidance. What number?
Mihir: I would say 7.5. Maybe 8 if it is a good mentor like mine.
Anna: Why 7.5 or 8, not higher?
Mihir: Because humans can be biased, or they can not understand my niche. Also, some coaches can be scammy. So I trust conditionally. But when I find a good one, I trust a lot.
Anna: Second, trust in AI tools for career guidance. What number?
Mihir: For career guidance, maybe 6. For technical learning, higher, like 8. But for career, 6.
Anna: Why 6?
Mihir: Because it is helpful and fast, but accuracy and context is uncertain. And it can give generic advice. So I trust it as an assistant, not as authority.
Anna: Third, perceived effectiveness of human support for your situation right now.
Mihir: Effectiveness, I think 7. Because mentor helped, but I need more continuous support. If I had a coach, maybe it could be 9, but I have not tried. So based on my experience, 7.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation right now.
Mihir: Hmm. Maybe 6.5. It helps a lot in small tasks, like translating job ads, drafting, learning. But for the big picture, it does not solve.
Anna: Great. Thanks. Now, I will describe a hybrid model briefly. Imagine a service where AI helps you explore options, translate job ads, draft CV bullets, and create a structured weekly plan. Then a human coach steps in for deeper sessions: choosing a direction, reviewing your story, practicing interviews, and accountability check-ins. How does that sound?
Mihir: That sounds like exactly what I need. Because AI can do the fast work, and human can do the deeper work. Also it could reduce cost, because human time is expensive. So if AI does preparation, human session is more focused. That sounds good.
Anna: What would you need to trust such a hybrid model?
Mihir: Transparency. Like, what does AI do, what does human do. And data privacy, like who sees my data. Also quality of the human coach, like matching. Because if I get wrong coach, then it fails. And also boundaries, like AI should not give legal advice about visa with exact numbers, but it can explain concepts. So clear boundaries.
Anna: Matching is a big one. What would make you feel the matching is good?
Mihir: If the coach understands international student path and engineering. Like, not a general life coach. Also maybe someone who worked in Germany hiring. And also personality fit. Like, I want structured, not too fluffy. I want someone who gives plan. So if the system asks me questions and matches based on that, I would trust more.
Anna: And what would make you suspicious or reduce trust in a hybrid model?
Mihir: If it feels like marketing, like promises too much. Or if the AI outputs are clearly generic. Or if they hide that AI is used. I prefer honesty. Also if they push me to buy more sessions. Like upsell. That would reduce trust.
Anna: If you had to choose today, for the next two months, what would your ideal support mix be?
Mihir: I think, AI daily for small tasks, like job ads, learning, drafting. And then a human coach maybe every week or every two weeks for direction and accountability. And maybe one mentor in industry for real insight. Like, if I can talk to someone at a company I target. That would be ideal.
Anna: And if we go deeper, what would you want the coach to deliver by the end of those two months, as concrete outputs?
Mihir: Output one: clear role direction, like embedded software engineer focusing on industrial or automotive or robotics. Output two: CV and LinkedIn story aligned. Output three: portfolio project with documentation. Output four: interview prep plan and practice sessions. Output five: application pipeline system. And maybe German learning plan for job context, like key phrases.
Anna: Oh wow. That is very structured. 
Mihir: Yes. Because structure calms me.
Anna: Mee too. When you imagine having that structure, what changes emotionally?
Mihir: I feel less like I am floating. Like, right now I feel like I am swimming with no shore. If I have a plan, I can breathe. Even if plan is hard, at least it is clear. Then I feel, okay, I am not wasting time. Then I can sleep better.
Anna: That is a strong image. Swimming with no shore.
Mihir: Yes. It is like that.
Anna: One last thing in this section. You said you are not against career coaches and you feel you need one urgently, but you have no idea where to find the right one. What would make it easier to find the right one?
Mihir: A place where coaches are vetted. Like, not random. Also where I can see, okay, this coach knows engineering, knows international students, knows Germany hiring. And reviews that are real. And maybe a first short call to check fit. And clear pricing. Because hidden pricing is suspicious.
Anna: Great.
9) Closing

Anna: We are coming to the end. I want to check if there is anything important we did not cover about your experiences with human support, AI tools, trust, or effectiveness.
Mihir: No.
Anna: Thank you, Mihir. That was very helpful and very clear. I will stop recording now. Any final questions for me?
Mihir: No questions. Thank you. It was actually nice to talk. 
Anna: Thanks. Take care.
Mihir: You too.




Katharina 
1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Katharina. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record this interview for research purposes? Everything will be anonymised, and you can skip any question.
Katharina: Yes, you have my permission to record. And thank you for saying I can skip. That already feels, um, safer. 
Anna: Great. And are you comfortable doing this mostly in English, with occasional German words if that feels more natural?
Katharina: Yes, totally. I work in English anyway. And sometimes I just say Gehalt or Jahresgespraech because it is faster.
Anna: Perfect. Just to set expectations, the interview is about your experience with career support, including human coaching and AI tools, and especially how you think about trust and perceived effectiveness. There are no right or wrong answers. If something feels too personal, we can move on. Does that work?
Katharina: Yes. I will try to be honest. Sometimes I notice I start to sound like I am presenting. So if I do that, tell me.
Anna: That is helpful. I may ask you to slow down or give an example, but I will not push you to share anything you do not want to. Could you start by introducing yourself briefly and what you do?
Katharina: Sure. I am Katharina, 28, born in Germany, and I live in Hamburg. I work as a product marketing specialist at a B2B software company. We are SaaS. We sell a platform that helps mid-market companies manage procurement workflows and supplier onboarding. So it is, like, supply chain and operations focused, not shiny consumer stuff. My role is product marketing, so positioning, messaging, launches, sales enablement, customer stories, sometimes competitive analysis, and internal stakeholder management, which is basically half the job. 
Anna: Great thank you. Let us start with your current career situation.
2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: Where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing, or recently faced?
Katharina: Um, I would say I am at this point where I am good at my job, and people trust me operationally, but I feel stuck. Like a plateau. The workload is high, I am involved in everything, but the path forward is unclear. I am not sure if I should aim for a PMM Lead track, like leading a small team or owning a bigger portfolio, or if I should pivot into product management. And then, connected to that, I avoided addressing a salary mismatch for too long. So my questions are: what is my next role, and how do I advocate for myself without burning bridges.
Anna: When you say you feel stuck, what does that look like day to day?
Katharina: It looks like this constant sprint mode. We have releases every two weeks, but real launches are more like monthly, and then bigger themes quarterly. And it is always messy because product changes scope late, sales wants certainty early, and marketing wants a clean story. I am in the middle. I do messaging docs, I build decks, I do training sessions, I write release notes that are actually product announcements, I coordinate with customer success for webinars, I chase people for approvals, I negotiate claims with legal, and I am also supposed to do research like win-loss and persona updates. There is never a quiet week. And because there is so much to do, I feel like I cannot step back and think strategically about my own career. I keep telling myself, later.
Anna: What was the most significant decision in the last 6 to 12 months?
Katharina: Investing in coaching. Like paying real money and committing time. That was the biggest decision because it meant I am admitting I cannot just power through. And it also meant I committed to two uncomfortable things: actually addressing salary, and exploring roles beyond my current company, including product roles. Before that, I was talking about it, but not doing it.
Anna: What made it difficult to make that decision?
Katharina: A few things. One is I am used to solving problems alone. Another is I was worried it would be a waste of money, like some fluffy advice. And also, time. Because the workload is high, so scheduling five sessions feels like another project. And honestly, I had a bit of shame. Like, why do I need help for something adults should figure out. But then I was also not sleeping well, and I had this feeling of, if I do not change something now, I will just slowly become bitter.
Anna: When did you notice the plateau? Was there a moment, or was it gradual?
Katharina: It was gradual. But there were two moments. One was a performance review cycle where my manager said, you are doing great, you are reliable, everyone likes working with you. And I was happy for five minutes, but then I realised, there is no concrete plan. No clear next step. Just more work. The second moment was when a new product manager joined and I was basically onboarding them on messaging and customer context, and they had a higher salary than me, which I found out indirectly. And I was like, wait. I am doing senior work, but I am paid like an earlier-career specialist.
Anna: That brings us to salary mismatch. Could you describe what you mean by mismatch, and how you avoided addressing it?
Katharina: So, I joined three years ago at 52k base. At the time I thought it was okay. Hamburg is expensive, but I was also coming from a smaller marketing job, and I was just happy to get into B2B SaaS. Over time my scope grew a lot. I was owning launches for two product areas: supplier onboarding and approval workflows. I also started mentoring a working student, I built the competitive battlecards, and I was running monthly enablement sessions. But my salary increases were small and very standard. Like 3 percent, then later a small bump when my title changed to specialist. But the market moved. Recruiters started reaching out with ranges like 65 to 75 for PMM roles. And then I compared with peers. Not exact, because Germany is weird about salary conversations, but I had enough signals that I was below the band for my impact.
Anna: And how did you avoid addressing it?
Katharina: By telling myself stories. Like, now is not the right time. The company is investing, budgets are tight. Or, there are salary bands, so nothing can change. Or, I should first prove myself in this one more launch. There is always a next milestone. Also, I told myself, if I ask, I will be seen as difficult. Like the annoying person who makes things about money. And I did not want that identity.
Anna: Under those stories, what was the fear?
Katharina: Fear of rejection. Fear of being told no, and then having to face what that means. Because if they say no, then either I accept it and feel undervalued, or I have to consider leaving, which is also scary because changing jobs is energy, interviews, uncertainty. And I was already tired. So avoidance felt like self-protection.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed at that point?
Katharina: Structure and accountability. And also someone who can hold the emotional part without making it therapy. Like, I did not need to talk about my childhood. I needed to talk about why I avoid money conversations and how to still do them. And I needed someone who knows the German corporate context, like salary bands, how performance reviews work, what is realistic in a negotiation.
Anna: What was your work background before this role?
Katharina: I did a Bachelor in business administration, and during that I had internships in marketing, mostly B2B. Then I worked two years in a smaller company in Hamburg, like a services company, doing marketing generalist work. Then I moved into SaaS. So in total I have around five to six years of work experience if you count internships, but three years in this specific PMM type role.
Anna: And in your current company, what is the structure like? Is it a startup, scaleup, corporate?
Katharina: It is like a scaleup. Around 250 people. Headquarters in Hamburg, but we have offices in Berlin and Munich too. Product and engineering are mostly Hamburg and Berlin. We sell to mid-market, and the sales cycle is longer, like three to six months. So PMM is heavy on enablement and proof points.
Anna: Okay. Let us talk about career support in general.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Katharina: Usually friends first. Some friends from university, some friends in tech. Then sometimes colleagues I trust, like one product manager who is very straightforward. I also read stuff online, like PMM career ladders and salary reports, but those can be generic. And I have used AI tools lightly, mainly for writing, like CV bullets or interview question lists.
Anna: What has actually helped, and what felt unhelpful or frustrating?
Katharina: Helpful is when someone gives structure and also asks uncomfortable questions. Like, what do you actually want, and what are you avoiding. And also, someone who understands the context. Like B2B, cross-functional politics, German salary norms. Unhelpful is generic encouragement. Like, you are great, you deserve more. It feels good, but it does not change behaviour.
Anna: Can you give an example of trusted but not effective support?
Katharina: Yes. My best friend from university. I trust her completely. She is kind, she listens. But she works in public sector communications. Her advice is shaped by that environment. She told me, just wait for the next review, they will recognise you, and do not push too much. And I felt emotionally supported, but it was not effective. It kept me passive. She did not challenge my avoidance because she hates conflict too. So it was trust without effectiveness.
Anna: And the opposite, effective but not trusted?
Katharina: AI is the obvious one. It can give me a pretty good template for a negotiation email or a structured interview answer. That is effective for that narrow task. But I do not trust it with sensitive context, like exact salary numbers or internal politics. So I do not share the real inputs, which means it cannot help with the deeper part.
Anna: If you think about your company environment, do people talk openly about career development?
Katharina: They say the right things. Like, we care about growth, we have frameworks. But in reality, it is mostly driven by business needs. Promotions happen when a team needs it or when someone threatens to leave. That is my cynical view. There are also good managers, but there is a lot of ambiguity.
Anna: What did you try before coaching to address the plateau?
Katharina: I tried working harder, honestly. Taking more ownership. I also tried asking my manager for a growth plan, but it stayed vague. Like, keep doing what you are doing, take more strategic initiatives. But no concrete milestones. I also tried doing informational chats internally with product managers, but those were informal and I did not follow through. And I read a lot of content about product management versus product marketing, but reading does not make decisions.
Anna: Okay. Let us move into your human coaching experience.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust

Anna: You mentioned a structured five-session coaching package with a certified coach. Can you describe what it was, how you found it, and what made you commit?
Katharina: Yes. I found the coach through a recommendation from a colleague, actually. She said the coach is certified and also used to working with people in tech. I checked her website, which looked serious, not too salesy. The package was five sessions, each 75 minutes. Three were online on Zoom, one was in-person in Hamburg, and the last one was online. There was also email support between sessions, like accountability check-ins. I committed because I realised I was spending energy avoiding decisions. And the cost, ironically, made it real. Like, if I pay, I will show up.
Anna: What was the cost range, if you feel comfortable sharing?
Katharina: It was around 1,100 euros for the package. So not cheap. I hesitated. But then I thought, I spend money on other things that do not change my life. And this might.
Anna: Tell me about the first session. What happened, and what was the early trust moment for you?
Katharina: The first session was very structured, which I loved. She started with confidentiality boundaries explicitly. She said, everything you share stays here, and she explained the only exceptions, like if there is a serious risk situation, but for career topics it is confidential. She also asked me what I need to feel safe in coaching. That surprised me. No one in work asked me that. And she outlined her process transparently. She said, we will clarify your situation, define a goal, identify blockers, build a plan, and practise the key conversations. It felt like a process, not a vibe.
Anna: When she asked what you need to feel safe, what did you answer?
Katharina: I said, I need confidentiality, obviously, and I need clear structure. And I said, I need challenge without shame. Like, you can confront me, but do not make me feel stupid. And she repeated it back, like, challenge without shaming, got it. And then she said, if at any point you feel shame in the room, tell me, because shame blocks learning. That was like, wow. That made me trust her quickly.
Anna: How else did trust form early?
Katharina: Competence. She understood the German corporate context. Like, she asked about salary bands, job levels, performance review cadence. She knew how managers talk here. And she did not jump into advice immediately. She asked questions first. That made me feel she is not projecting. Also, she was consistent. She ended the session with clear homework and clear next steps. That reliability builds trust for me.
Anna: What were your trust drivers for a human coach, if you list them out?
Katharina: Confidentiality, structure, competence in my market, empathy, challenge, consistency, and being seen. Like remembering details, catching patterns, not just listening passively.
Anna: Did you have any doubts about her early on?
Katharina: A little. I was worried it would be too psychological and not practical. Because I am a practical person. But she balanced it. She would explore the emotional blockers and then translate into action. That is what made it work.
Anna: Can you describe a moment where she challenged you without shaming, and it changed your behaviour?
Katharina: Yes. In session two, I was talking about salary in a very analytical way. I was describing benchmarks, role scope, market ranges. And she stopped me and said, you are speaking like a consultant. Where are you in this story. What are you actually afraid of. I got quiet. I felt exposed. But her tone was calm, not accusing. And then she said, I am not asking to judge you, I am asking because fear is driving your actions more than data. And I admitted, I am afraid they will say no and then I will feel small, and I will have to decide whether to leave. That admission changed the work. After that, we did not pretend it is just a rational negotiation. We worked on the fear response too.
Anna: What was it like to say that out loud?
Katharina: It was uncomfortable. I felt like, oh my god, I am 28 and I am scared of a conversation. But also relieving. Because it was the truth. And once it was spoken, it felt less like this shadow that controls everything.
Anna: How did it change your behaviour after that session?
Katharina: It shifted me from endless preparation to action. Because before, I would say, I need more data, more proof. After that, I realised, no amount of data will remove fear. So we practised the conversation and planned timing. Also, I started noticing avoidance in other areas. Like I avoid asking product for clarity because I do not want conflict. And I started being more direct.
Anna: You mentioned concrete outcomes: a target role list, negotiation script, two mock interviews, and a six-week plan with weekly accountability. Could you walk me through each outcome and what it looked like?
Katharina: Sure. We basically treated it like a mini project.
Katharina: Outcome one: target role list. We defined two tracks. Track A was product marketing path, aiming for Senior PMM or PMM Lead. Track B was product management, but realistically associate PM roles, because I do not have direct PM ownership. For each track, we created a list of companies and roles, including salary ranges, location constraints, and what skills I need. It was a spreadsheet. Very German.
Katharina: Outcome two: negotiation script. We built a structure for the salary conversation: opening, rationale, ask, silence, handling objections, next steps. We wrote example lines, and we practised saying them out loud without softening.
Katharina: Outcome three: two mock interviews. One mock interview was tailored to a PMM lead style role. The other was tailored to an associate PM role, with product case questions and prioritisation. We recorded them, and I reviewed my answers.
Katharina: Outcome four: six-week plan with weekly accountability. She created weekly themes and tasks, and I had to send a Friday update. It was simple but it worked.
Anna: Let us go deeper into the target role list. What did you actually put on it?
Katharina: We listed about, um, 18 roles total. For PMM, we listed companies like mid-size SaaS in Hamburg, Berlin remote-friendly companies, and a few larger ones with PMM teams. I avoided mega corporations because I do not want pure politics. For product, we listed associate PM roles in B2B platforms, because my domain knowledge is supply chain and procurement. We also listed internal options like moving into a product operations type role, or taking ownership of a roadmap area informally. But we were honest that internal pivots are slow.
Anna: What criteria did you use to decide what is a good role?
Katharina: We used criteria like: learning curve, autonomy, manager quality, workload realism, and salary. Also how cross-functional the role is. I like cross-functional, but I want healthier boundaries. And location, because I live in Hamburg and I do not want to relocate. I could do occasional travel, but not moving.
Anna: What did you learn from comparing PMM lead versus product management?
Katharina: I learned that my desire for product management is partly a desire for more influence, and partly an escape fantasy. Like, if I become PM, then I will be respected and paid more, and my work will be more strategic. But that is not automatically true. Product can be just as chaotic. And PMM lead path is more realistic short-term because I already have strength there. The coach helped me see that I can also negotiate influence within PMM, like owning strategy, not just execution.
Anna: Now negotiation script. Can you share one or two example lines you practised, without quoting them as a script, just describing them?
Katharina: Yes. We practised starting with a calm frame, like saying I want to discuss compensation aligned with my scope and market benchmarks. Then stating my target number clearly, like targeting 65k base, based on comparable PMM roles in Hamburg. And then anchoring it in impact, like the launches I owned, enablement outcomes, adoption metrics. And we practised a line for salary band objections, like asking what band my role is mapped to and what is required to move within it or to the next level. That line was powerful because it shifts from personal pleading to process.
Anna: How did you practise? Was it just repeating, or role-play?
Katharina: Role-play. She played my manager, and she pushed back. Like, she said, budget is tight, or we can revisit later, or you are doing great but. And I had to respond without collapsing. We also practised silence. She literally made me sit in silence after stating the number. That was hard because I fill silence with explanations.
Anna: What was your default pattern in those role-plays?
Katharina: Over-explaining and apologising. Like, I would say, if possible, or I know it is a lot, or I understand. And she stopped me. She said, you can be polite without shrinking. That was a key learning.
Anna: Tell me about the actual salary conversation in real life. What happened?
Katharina: Okay. So I scheduled a meeting with my manager, framed as development and compensation alignment. I did it after a successful launch, not during a crisis week. The meeting was 45 minutes. I started with a summary of my scope changes over the last year, like owning two product areas, enablement, mentoring. Then I said I want to align my compensation with that scope and the market. I stated the target number, 65k base. My manager did not react dramatically. He said, thank you for being direct, and he asked me what data I used. I shared two sources, like recruiter ranges and an internal level mapping we have.
Anna: How did he respond regarding bands?
Katharina: He said there are salary bands and my current salary is within the band for my level, but near the lower end. He also said moving to 65k might require a level change, like senior specialist. He suggested a step approach: an immediate adjustment plus a plan for level change in the next cycle. And he asked if I would be open to taking on a more strategic initiative, like owning messaging for a new module and mentoring a junior person formally.
Anna: How did you feel in that moment?
Katharina: Relief, because he did not reject me. Also a bit annoyed, because it felt like, of course I am already doing more, but now it is formalised. But I stayed calm. The coach helped me not take it personally. We agreed on next steps: he would talk to HR and come back in two weeks. And we scheduled a follow-up.
Anna: And what was the outcome?
Katharina: The outcome was, I got an increase to 58k immediately, effective next month. And we set a target for moving to senior specialist by the next review, with a band that would put me around 62 to 64, depending on performance and budget. So I did not get 65 right away. But it was a meaningful correction. Also, the conversation itself was a huge win, because I stopped avoiding it. And now I have a documented plan.
Anna: That sounds realistic. How did you interpret that result emotionally?
Katharina: Mixed. Part of me was like, finally. Part of me was like, I should have asked earlier. And part of me was like, maybe I should still explore external options because internal movement is slow. The coach helped me hold that complexity without spiralling.
Anna: Let us talk about the mock interviews. What happened in the first mock interview? What questions were hardest?
Katharina: In the first mock interview for PMM lead, she asked questions like: describe a launch that did not go well, how do you measure PMM impact, how do you handle conflict between product and sales, and tell me about a time you influenced stakeholders without authority. Those were hard because I have examples, but I would ramble. I would go into details about stakeholder drama and forget to state results. Also, I realised I under-sell my impact because I say we, not I.
Anna: And what improved after the second mock interview?
Katharina: After the second, I was more structured. I used a simple structure: context, action, result, learning. I also got better at naming metrics. Like, for a launch, I mentioned adoption rate, sales cycle influence, demo conversion, or enablement completion. Even if metrics are imperfect, stating them shows you think about outcomes. And I stopped apologising in my answers. That was big.
Anna: For the associate PM mock interview, what was challenging?
Katharina: Prioritisation. She asked a case like: you have three feature requests, sales wants A, customers complain about B, engineering wants C, how do you decide. And I could reason, but I felt insecure because I do not own a roadmap now. We reframed my PMM experience as relevant because I have customer insight, competitive context, and cross-functional coordination. I learned to speak in trade-offs, not just messaging.
Anna: Now the six-week plan. Can you describe what you actually did week by week, not just the plan on paper?
Katharina: Yes. Week 1, I gathered data and wrote a baseline. I collected job descriptions, salary ranges from recruiter conversations, and I mapped my current responsibilities. I also tracked my time for one week to see where I actually spend time. 
Katharina: Week 2, I did role exploration. I had two informational chats. One with a PMM Lead in a Berlin SaaS company, and one with an associate PM in Hamburg. I also talked to an internal PM about what skills I would need. Week 3, I updated my CV and LinkedIn. I rewrote bullets to focus on impact, like improved enablement adoption, reduced sales cycle confusion, and led messaging for two modules. I also created a small portfolio doc with two launch case studies, one successful, one messy, showing what I learned.
Anna: Oh wow and next.
Katharina: Week 4, negotiation prep. This was the hardest week because we had a big release and there was chaos. I missed one accountability update because I was exhausted. But then I recovered. I practised the salary script twice, once with the coach and once alone. I also wrote down my fear responses, like if they say no, what do I do.
Katharina: Then week 5, execution. I had the salary conversation with my manager. And I submitted three applications, two PMM roles and one associate PM. I also reached out to a recruiter contact.
Katharina: And week 6, iteration. I reviewed what worked, adjusted my plan, and kept tracking metrics. I also had the follow-up salary meeting. And I did one more interview prep session because I got a screening call.
Anna: You mentioned weekly accountability. What did that look like, concretely?
Katharina: Every Friday by 6 pm, I sent a short update email or message. Five bullet points: what I did, what I avoided, what I learned, what is next, and what support I need. The coach replied with one or two questions. Sometimes she just asked, what is the smallest next action you can do in 15 minutes. That question is annoying but effective. It breaks the procrastination.
Anna: Did you ever feel resistance to the accountability?
Katharina: Yes. Sometimes I felt like, I am already overloaded, now I have homework. And sometimes I felt childish, like I need someone to check on me. But then I noticed it works. And the tone was not policing. It was supportive, but firm.
Anna: This is a good moment to ask about micro-poll ratings. I will ask four quick ratings, 0 to 10, and I want your reasoning. First: trust in human coaches, in general.
Katharina: In general, I would say 7 out of 10.
Anna: Why 7?
Katharina: Because I believe humans can create real relational safety and challenge. But quality varies a lot. Some coaches are too fluffy or too generic. And trust depends on competence and boundaries. So I trust the potential, but not automatically the person.
Anna: Second rating: trust in AI tools for career support.
Katharina: 4 out of 10.
Anna: Why 4?
Katharina: Because I trust it for low-stakes tasks like rewriting text or generating a checklist. I do not trust it for sensitive context or high-stakes decisions. Also, I do not fully trust privacy, and I do not trust that it understands my specific situation. It can sound confident while being generic.
Anna: Third rating: perceived effectiveness of human coaching for your situation.
Katharina: 8 out of 10.
Anna: Why 8 and not higher?
Katharina: Because it created concrete outcomes and behaviour change, but it did not solve everything. I still have workload constraints. And some uncertainty remains about whether I pivot to product. Coaching helped me act and reduce avoidance, but it is not magic.
Anna: Fourth rating: perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation.
Katharina: 5 out of 10.
Anna: Why slightly higher than trust?
Katharina: Because effectiveness for me includes speed and output. AI can create a useful output even if I do not trust it deeply, because I do not share sensitive inputs. So it is effective in narrow tasks, like templates, bullet rewriting, interview question lists. But it is not effective for deep behaviour change.
Anna: Great. Let us continue with AI tools in more detail.
5) AI tools: experience and trust

Anna: What AI tools have you used, and for what career-related tasks?
Katharina: Mostly ChatGPT. I also tried one CV tool that claims it optimises for ATS, but it was not great. With ChatGPT, I used it to rewrite CV bullets, like turning my messy sentence into an impact bullet. I also used it to brainstorm interview questions for PMM roles and to draft a follow-up email after an interview. And one time I asked it for a negotiation script structure.
Anna: What did you like about it?
Katharina: Speed and structure. Like, if I am staring at a blank page, it gives me something to react to. It also helps me reduce perfectionism because I can iterate faster. And it does not judge. If I ask a basic question, it does not roll its eyes. 
Anna: And what did you dislike or distrust?
Katharina: Lack of context and relational safety. It cannot sense when I am avoiding. It cannot hold discomfort. It also does not know my company culture. And I do not want to type in sensitive details like internal politics or exact salaries. So I self-censor. That limits usefulness.
Anna: Do you think trust in AI could increase for you, and under what conditions?
Katharina: Maybe, if there were very clear data boundaries and if it was transparent about uncertainty. Like, if it says, I am not sure, here are options, rather than sounding confident. And if it could remember context safely, but that is also scary. Because remembering context means storing data. So I am conflicted.
Anna: Can you describe a specific moment when AI was effective for you, even if you did not fully trust it?
Katharina: Yes. The negotiation email template. I wanted to request a meeting with my manager without making it sound like a threat. AI suggested a calm structure: frame it as development and compensation alignment, propose a time, and mention you want to prepare and share context. That was effective. But I did not include my salary number or detailed frustrations. I kept it generic.
Anna: And a moment when AI output was not effective?
Katharina: When I asked for salary benchmarks in Hamburg for PMM. It gave ranges that felt too broad and not grounded. And it sounded very certain. That made me cautious. I then used actual salary reports and recruiter conversations instead. So it reminded me: AI can be wrong in a confident tone.
Anna: How do you define trust for AI, compared to trust for humans?
Katharina: For AI, trust is more like reliability and predictability. Does it give a coherent structure, does it not hallucinate too much, does it respect boundaries. For humans, trust includes emotional safety, confidentiality, and being seen. It is more relational. AI cannot do that in the same way.
Anna: And how do you define effectiveness, separately?
Katharina: Effectiveness is: did it help me move forward. Did it create clarity, action, measurable outcomes, confidence, reduced avoidance. For AI, effectiveness might be faster drafting. For human coaching, effectiveness is behaviour change, like actually having the salary conversation.
Anna: You said earlier that coaching felt like a psychologist for career questions. Could you expand on that in relation to AI?
Katharina: Yes. The coach noticed patterns. Like when I intellectualise or when I avoid. And she could challenge me gently. That is psychological. AI can reflect language patterns a bit, but it does not feel like a real mirror. And also, I do not want AI to be my therapist. That feels wrong. I want it to be a tool.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: I want to compare human coaching and AI via specific tasks. I will list tasks and ask which one you prefer, and why. Task one: clarifying options and direction, like PMM lead versus product management.
Katharina: Human. Because direction is tied to values and fears. AI can list pros and cons, but it cannot ask the right uncomfortable question in a human way. My coach could say, you say you want product, but are you escaping something. That question mattered.
Anna: Would you use AI at all for that task?
Katharina: As a support tool. Like generating a competency matrix: what skills PMM lead needs, what skills associate PM needs. Or drafting questions to ask in informational interviews. That is great. But the decision-making and meaning part, human.
Anna: Task two: planning concrete steps and maintaining momentum.
Katharina: Hybrid. AI can generate templates and reminders, but human accountability was what made me actually do it. I do not feel accountable to AI. I can ignore notifications. With a human, I felt, I committed, and she will notice.
Anna: Task three: CV and application writing.
Katharina: AI is good for wording. Human is good for narrative. So again hybrid. AI can rewrite bullets, but a human can help me choose what story to tell. Like, am I positioning myself as PMM lead, or as a pivot to product. That is strategy.
Anna: Task four: interview preparation.
Katharina: Both. AI can generate question lists and help structure answers. Human can simulate pressure and give feedback on my presence and confidence. My coach caught things like I shrink my voice when talking about money or impact. AI would not catch that.
Anna: Task five: salary negotiation.
Katharina: Human. Because it is emotional. I needed role-play and someone to push back realistically. AI can give scripts, but I would not share the real fear, and I would not practise the awkward parts. And the awkward parts are the point.
Anna: You already gave examples of trusted but not effective and effective but not trusted. I want to make sure we capture those clearly. Could you restate one example of trusted but not effective, and one example of effective but not trusted?
Katharina: Trusted but not effective: my university friend. I trust her fully, but her advice was generic and kept me passive. Effective but not trusted: AI negotiation template. It produced a useful structure, but I did not trust it with sensitive context, so it stayed shallow.
Anna: Do you have an example where you trusted a human coach but something was not effective, at least in a small way?
Katharina: Hmm. Yes. Sometimes I trusted her process, but a specific exercise did not land. Like she asked me to visualise an ideal day in five years. I found it too abstract. I trust her, but that exercise did not directly help. We moved on quickly. So trust does not guarantee every tool is effective. But overall it was.
Anna: And do you have an example where AI was effective but you felt it was not safe or you would not rely on it?
Katharina: Yes. When I asked for possible interview answers about conflict management, it gave a nice structure. But I would not copy it directly because it can sound generic and not truthful. And I would not want to reveal my real internal conflicts to it. So I used it as a base, but not as a truth source.
Anna: In your B2B PMM reality, what are the biggest tensions you manage between stakeholders?
Katharina: Product wants to ship, and they hate marketing language. Sales wants clear claims and competitive differentiation. Customer success wants stability and fewer surprises. Marketing wants consistency across channels. And leadership wants results. PMM is always negotiating priorities. Like, product says, we cannot commit to dates, and sales says, we need dates. I end up translating. That translation work is not always visible, but it is critical.
Anna: How does that context affect what you want from coaching?
Katharina: I needed someone who understands that my stress is not just workload, it is relational complexity. I am constantly managing expectations. Coaching helped me set boundaries, like saying no to last-minute requests, and also helped me frame my impact in that messy environment.
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to focus directly on the link between trust and perceived effectiveness. In your experience, how does trust affect whether coaching is effective?
Katharina: For me, trust is the gateway. If I trust the coach, I admit the real thing I am avoiding. And that real thing drives behaviour change. Without trust, I stay on the surface. Like, help me write a better CV. With trust, I can say, I am terrified of being rejected, and I feel guilty asking for money. That changed what we worked on. And because we worked on the real blocker, the coaching became effective.
Anna: You said trust formed early because of confidentiality boundaries, transparent process, and challenge without shame. Can you describe that early trust moment in more detail, like what she said or did, and what you felt?
Katharina: In the first session, she explained confidentiality very clearly, and she asked me what safety means for me. That alone was huge. Then she said something like, we will go at a pace that is challenging but not overwhelming, and you are in control. She also set boundaries for herself, like she is not my friend, she is my coach, and the container is the session. That professionalism felt safe. I felt, okay, this is not gossip, this is not judgement, this is work.
Anna: How did that trust translate into actions or outcomes?
Katharina: Because I trusted her, I did the homework. I sent the Friday updates. I practised the script even when it felt cringe. And I admitted when I avoided something. Like week 4, when I missed the update, I told her I felt ashamed. If I did not trust her, I would have disappeared. That continuity created momentum, which created outcomes.
Anna: Let us go back to salary avoidance. What story did you tell yourself, and what fear was underneath?
Katharina: The story was: it is not the right time, budgets are tight, salary bands mean it is fixed, I should just be grateful and prove myself more. Underneath was fear of hearing no and feeling undervalued. And fear of having to choose, stay or leave. And also fear of being seen as greedy or difficult.
Anna: What triggered the shift from avoidance to action?
Katharina: Two things. One was external validation: recruiter ranges and seeing that my market value is higher. That made it concrete. The second was the coach asking me to name the fear. Once I named it, I could not hide behind spreadsheets. It became a behavioural issue, not a data issue.
Anna: You said coaching is high-impact when it includes structure plus relational safety. Could you explain what each part contributed?
Katharina: Structure gave me a path and reduced overwhelm. It turned vague anxiety into weekly steps. Relational safety allowed me to be honest about what I avoid. Without safety, structure becomes a checklist I can fake. Without structure, safety becomes a nice conversation that does not change my life. The combination is what made it high-impact.
Anna: You also said it feels like a psychologist for career questions, not therapy. How does that fit into trust and effectiveness?
Katharina: It fits because psychological insight is needed for behaviour change. But it needs boundaries. Therapy can go into family dynamics and deeper trauma. Coaching stayed focused: workplace patterns, decision-making, communication. That boundary made me trust it, because I did not feel it would spiral into something too heavy. And that focus made it effective, because we stayed on actions.
Anna: You now track outcomes. How does tracking connect to trust and effectiveness?
Katharina: Tracking makes effectiveness visible. Otherwise it is just feelings. I track applications sent, interviews, salary conversation milestones. I also track a weekly avoidance score, like did I do the hard thing. Seeing numbers motivates me. And it also reduces shame. Like, if I did not apply this week, I can see why, maybe workload. It becomes data. That is something my coach modelled. So trust enabled me to be honest, and then tracking made progress measurable.
Anna: Could you give me the specific metrics you track and how often?
Katharina: Weekly, I track: number of applications submitted, number of networking reach-outs, number of interview invites, and number of interview prep sessions. For salary, I track: meeting scheduled, meeting done, follow-up scheduled, decision received. And I track my mood, like 1 to 5, and sleep quality, because career stress affects my mental stability. It is simple, not a full mental health app. Just awareness.
Anna: How has tracking affected your motivation?
Katharina: It helps me not catastrophise. Like, if I feel stuck, I can look and see, actually I had two interviews this month. Or I made one salary conversation happen. That builds confidence. It also shows me when I am avoiding. If a week is empty, I can ask, what happened. And then I can adjust.
Anna: If trust is the gateway, what would happen if trust was low with a coach?
Katharina: I would perform. I would talk about safe topics. I would not admit fear. And then the coaching would be less effective, because it would stay at surface tactics. It might still help a bit, but not the high-impact kind.
Anna: And with AI, you described a different pattern. How does the trust-effectiveness link look there?
Katharina: It is more transactional. AI can be effective without deep trust because I keep it in a safe zone. I do not share sensitive stuff, so it cannot help with that, but it can still help with drafting. So trust limits the scope. And because the scope is limited, effectiveness is limited too. That is basically the relationship.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction

Anna: Imagine a hybrid model where AI supports preparation and follow-up, like structuring goals, drafting documents, and tracking tasks, and a human coach focuses on deeper conversations, accountability, and high-stakes moments. What is your reaction?
Katharina: That sounds ideal. Because AI can reduce admin and make things efficient. I do not need a human to rewrite a bullet point ten times. But I need a human to challenge avoidance and to role-play difficult conversations. And I need accountability from a person. I can ignore an app, but I do not want to ignore a human I respect. 
Anna: What would make you trust a hybrid model?
Katharina: Clear boundaries. Like, what data is stored, what is shared with the coach, what stays private. Also, transparency about what AI does and does not do. If AI is positioned as advice, that is risky. If it is positioned as structure and drafting support, okay. And the human needs to own the ethical part and the nuance.
Anna: Where would you prefer AI to lead, and where would you prefer the human to lead?
Katharina: AI can lead in templates, tracking, reminders, and generating question lists. Human should lead in values clarification, identity questions, emotional blockers, negotiation practice, conflict handling, and interpreting context. Also, anything involving risk, like leaving a job or confronting a manager.
Anna: If you had to design your ideal career support experience, what would it look like in practice?
Katharina: It would start with two human sessions to clarify direction and blockers. Then an AI tool would help me set up a plan and track tasks. Then weekly, a short human check-in for accountability and reflection. And AI would help in between with drafting and prep. Also, I would want the human coach to be trained and certified, not just a random influencer. And I would want the whole thing to feel professional, not like motivational content.
Anna: What concerns would you have about a hybrid approach?
Katharina: Misalignment. Like if AI suggests something that conflicts with the coach, I would be confused. Also privacy. And the risk that AI makes it feel too transactional, losing the relational safety. If the system pushes me to input sensitive feelings into a tool, I would resist. I want my emotions to be held by a human, not by a chatbot.
Anna: If you think about your own timeline, would AI have helped you more at the beginning or later?
Katharina: Later. At the beginning, I needed relational safety to admit what I was avoiding. AI could not give me that. Once I had momentum, AI could support maintaining it.
Anna: You mentioned mental stability and career satisfaction. How do you connect that to seeking help?
Katharina: People spend most of their time at work. If work is constantly stressful and you feel stuck, it leaks into everything. For me, I noticed I was irritable, I slept badly, I avoided social plans because I was tired. Coaching helped me feel more stable because I had a plan and I took action. That reduced the background anxiety. So seeking help is not weakness. It is, um, maintenance. Like mental hygiene. And I want to be careful because it is not therapy, but it still affects mental stability.
Anna: That is clear. Let us close soon, but I want to make sure we captured the specific concrete episodes the study needs. I will ask a few targeted questions. First, the early trust moment. You described confidentiality and process. Was there a specific moment you remember thinking, okay I can trust this person?
Katharina: Yes. It was when she said, tell me what you need to feel safe, and then she repeated it back without judgement. And then when I said, I am ashamed about the salary topic, she did not reassure me in a fake way. She said, shame is common here, and we will work with it. That made me feel normal, not broken.
Anna: Second, the challenge without shaming moment. You described her calling out that you were speaking like a consultant. Did that feel risky?
Katharina: Yes, but in a good way. It felt like she sees through my defence. But her tone was respectful, not mocking. If she had laughed or pushed too hard, I would have shut down. Instead, I felt invited.
Anna: Third, negotiation script practice. Besides stating the number, what was the hardest part?
Katharina: Silence and handling pushback. Like when my manager says, budgets are tight. My instinct is to retreat. Practising responses helped, like asking for process clarity, asking what would be required, agreeing on a timeline. Also, not taking it personally.
Anna: Fourth, mock interviews. What question made you stumble the most, and what changed?
Katharina: The question about measuring PMM impact. I started talking about assets, like decks and webinars. Then she stopped me and said, those are outputs, what are outcomes. That changed my framing. After practice, I could talk about adoption, pipeline influence, and reduced sales confusion.
Anna: Fifth, the six-week plan. What did the weekly accountability feel like emotionally? Motivation, pressure, both?
Katharina: Both. Motivation because I wanted to report progress. Pressure sometimes, but it was healthy pressure. It kept me honest. Also, the coach did not punish me when I failed. She used it as information. That reduced fear.
Anna: Great. I think we have it. Let us move to closing.
9) Closing

Anna: Is there anything else you want to add about trust and perceived effectiveness, maybe something people misunderstand?
Katharina: No, not really. 
Anna: Thank you. Final check are you comfortable with the topics we covered today and the level of detail?
Katharina: Yes. It is anonymous I mean.
Anna: Great. Then I will stop the recording here. Thank you for your time, Katharina.
Katharina: Thank you. It was. 


Amir 
1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Amir, thanks for making the time today. How are you?
Amir: Hi Anna. I am good, eehm, a bit tired because I had a lab meeting this morning, but yeah, good.
Anna: Makes sense. Before we start, I want to confirm consent. Do I have your permission to record this interview? Everything is anonymized, and you can skip any question at any time.
Amir: Yes, you can record. That is okay.
Anna: Thank you. And just checking, are there any topics you would prefer not to discuss today?
Amir: Um, I think it is fine. Maybe nothing super personal, like family details. But career stuff, identity stuff, that is okay.
Anna: Absolutely. We will stay within what feels comfortable. If anything feels too personal, just tell me and we move on.
Amir: Cool.
Anna: Great. Let us begin.
2) Participant context and career situation
Anna: To start, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing right now, or recently faced?
Amir: Okay. So, I am 24, I am from Iran, and I have been in Germany four years now. I am based in Cologne, in Köln. I am finishing my Master in Human-Computer Interaction. It is like, eehm, between computer science and psychology, you know. My current situation is I am writing my thesis and also working part-time as a working student in UX research.
Anna: What kind of company is it?
Amir: It is a SaaS company, B2B, like a platform for internal workflows, kind of. Not like a sexy consumer app. But interesting problems. The team is small. There is one lead UX researcher and then me and one UX designer, and product managers, engineers, you know. I do mostly research ops and some interviews and surveys.
Anna: And what is the biggest career decision you have faced in the last six to twelve months?
Amir: The biggest one was probably choosing my thesis scope and also, like, choosing what kind of first full-time role I should optimize for. Because the thesis topic can lock you in a bit, at least in your narrative. Like if I do something very academic, then I can say I want research track, PhD, blah blah. But if I do something more applied, then it is easier to say I want product research. And then there is the visa thing. I am on a student residence permit now. I need the job after graduation. So the decision is not purely what I like, it is also what is feasible.
Anna: What made that difficult?
Amir: Um. Multiple constraints. First, the job market right now is weird. Like, internships and working student roles are still okay, but junior full-time roles in UX research are not so many. Especially if you need visa sponsorship, you know. Second, language. My German is okay for daily life, like I can handle Bürgeramt, I can order food, I can do small talk. But in professional settings, research interviews in German, that is hard. So I ask myself, do I focus on English-speaking roles, or do I push German fast. And third, identity, like, what kind of life I want. Stability or autonomy. Like I enjoy structured work, but also I hate feeling stuck.
Anna: When you say identity, what does that mean for you in this context?
Amir: It is like, who am I trying to become in the next two years. Like, do I want to be a very serious researcher, publish papers, conferences, CHI, that world. Or do I want to be more product, shipping, fast feedback loops. And then there is the immigrant lens, like, do I want to stay in Germany long term, apply for Blue Card later, or do I keep the option to move, maybe Netherlands, maybe Canada, I do not know. It is not like I can just pick a vibe. There are consequences.
Anna: What kind of support did you feel you needed while making those decisions?
Amir: I needed, um, two things. One is clarity. Like not motivational talk, but clarity. And the second is emotional regulation. Because I can think a lot. I overthink. I can build a whole decision tree and still feel anxious. So I needed someone or something that can help me name what I am actually afraid of, and then structure it.
Anna: That is helpful. And your thesis, what is it on right now?
Amir: So, my thesis is on how people use AI tools for reflective practices in work contexts. Like, not purely productivity, but reflective thinking, learning from experience. It is like, I studied journaling, reflection prompts, and then how AI changes the affordances. I am doing interviews with early-career people actually. So it is meta.
Anna: That is quite aligned with your own habits then.
Amir: Yes, exactly. That is also why it was hard, because it is personally relevant and I can bias myself. So I had to be careful.
Anna: We will come back to that when we talk about AI tools. Before that, tell me a bit about your background. What did you study before the Master?
Amir: In Iran I did undergrad in industrial engineering, but I focused on systems design and some programming. Then I came to Germany, I did a bridge year, language, and then I started the HCI Master. I also did some student projects in interaction design, usability testing, and like, one project with Deutsche Bahn data, but more conceptual.
Anna: And student life in Cologne, how is it for you?
Amir: Cologne is good. It is open, people are friendly compared to some other cities. There is like, this vibe, more relaxed. People say, Köln ist ein Dorf, you see the same people. For me, student life is also like working student life. Because I work 20 hours. So it is not like partying all the time. But I have routines, like I go to a cafe near Zülpicher Platz, I study, I meet friends. It is okay.
3. Career support in general
Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Amir: Um. First, I use AI tools a lot, but not for CV mainly. More for reflection. Second, I talk with two friends. One is also international, from Turkey, doing data science. Another is German, doing product management. We do like, reality checks for each other. And third, sometimes I talk to my supervisor at university, but that is more academic direction.
Anna: What kind of support do you get from your workplace?
Amir: From work, not official. There is no mentoring program. But my lead researcher is supportive. She gives feedback, like, how to frame my impact, how to communicate. But she is busy. And also I do not want to be too needy. So I use her for concrete questions, like, what skills matter, what portfolios matter, how to prepare for interviews.
Anna: Have you used university career services in Germany?
Amir: Once. At the university we have career counseling, like a workshop. I attended a seminar about Bewerbungen and networking. It was helpful for basics, but it was very generic. Also it was in German. I understood, but I was like, okay, this is not my main problem. My problem is not how to format a CV, it is like, what am I optimizing for, and what trade-offs I accept.
Anna: What has actually helped you in the past, and what felt unhelpful?
Amir: Helpful is when someone helps me reduce the problem into something actionable. Like, you have three options, define evaluation criteria, run small experiments. Unhelpful is when people just say, follow your passion, or, everything will work out. That makes me angry, honestly. Because it ignores the visa reality, and the job market reality.
Anna: So you value realism and structure.
Amir: Yes. But also I need emotional space. It is not only structure. It is like, structure plus permission to be uncertain.
4. Human coaching: experience and trust
Anna: Have you ever tried human career coaching, like a private coach, mentor, or career counselor, in a one-to-one format?
Amir: I tried one session, actually. It was through a program at the university, like alumni mentoring. It was not exactly coaching, more mentoring. One session, one hour.
Anna: What was it like?
Amir: It was limited. The person was nice, German, he worked in HR at a big company. He asked me about my background, and then he gave advice like, apply widely, build network, improve German. It was not wrong. But it did not go deep. Also I felt I had to perform confidence. Like, I had to show I am motivated, I am proactive. And maybe it is cultural, but I did not want to share my doubts, like, I am scared I will not get a job and then I have to leave. Because then I feel weak.
Anna: What do you think made it hard to go deeper?
Amir: Two things. First, lack of continuity. One session, there is no trust built. Second, I did not know if he really understands my context. Like, he is German, he never had visa pressure. He can say, just take your time. For me, time is not neutral. And also, I did not know what he expects. In Germany, people can be direct, but also professional. I did not want to overshare.
Anna: When you think about trust in a human coach or mentor, what would make a human feel trustworthy for you?
Amir: Competence, like understanding UX research and the job market, not only general advice. And also, confidentiality, like they explicitly say, this stays here. And the vibe. Like, if I feel judged, then no. If I feel they are trying to push me into a standard path, also no. And also, I need them to ask good questions, not only give advice. If they only give advice, then it is like, okay, you are just a blog post.
Anna: And what would make a human untrustworthy?
Amir: If they are too confident without understanding my situation. Or if they project their own story. Like, I did this, so you should do this. Also if they treat me like a problem to fix. Or if they are, um, biased. Like, I had one experience in a networking event where someone kind of assumed, because I am international, that I will take any job. That makes me close.
Anna: If you had to put a number on it, a micro-poll, 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is full trust, what is your current trust in human coaches for career topics?
Amir: Eehm. I would say 6.
Anna: And why 6?
Amir: Because I know humans can be very insightful and empathetic, and they can understand nuance. But for me, the access is limited, the match is uncertain, and I do not know if they understand visa constraints. So I trust the potential, not the default.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness, same scale 0 to 10, how effective do you think human coaching would be for your situation right now?
Amir: Maybe 5.
Anna: Why lower than trust?
Amir: Because even if I trust them, it may not translate to action, due to cost, time, or mismatch. Like, I can have a nice talk and feel supported, but then what. Also I think for my kind of problems, a lot is internal decision making. A coach can help, but they cannot remove the constraints. So effectiveness is moderate.
Anna: That distinction is important. Thank you.
5. AI tools: experience and trust
Anna: Now I want to go deeper into AI tools. You mentioned you use AI as a structured reflection partner, almost like guided journaling, three to four times per week. Can you describe what that looks like in practice?
Amir: Yes. So I have a routine. Usually in the evening, after work or after studying. Like 20 to 40 minutes. I open the AI chat, and I start with a check-in. I literally write, current state, and then I list, energy level, mood, main concern. It sounds like therapy, but it is not therapy. It is like, data plus feelings.
Anna: What happens after the check-in?
Amir: Then I paste my personal prompt. I have a template. It says something like, mirror my assumptions, list possible biases, ask me two clarifying questions, and then propose decision principles, not decisions. That last part is important. I do not want it to decide for me. I want it to help me create principles.
Anna: Can you give an example of the prompt template, without exact wording if you prefer?
Amir: Yeah, roughly it is: First, restate what I said in a structured way, like bullet points. Second, identify my hidden assumptions. Third, identify cognitive biases, like loss aversion, catastrophizing, whatever. Fourth, ask me questions that challenge me. Fifth, propose a framework, but keep it light, not too many. And then I ask it to propose two or three decision principles that I can reuse.
Anna: How did you develop that routine?
Amir: It evolved. At first I used AI like everyone, for quick questions. Then I noticed I am using it to think. Like I can type and it reflects. And then I realized, if I want it to be consistent, I need to design the interaction. HCI mindset, you know. Like, I can create an interface behavior through prompts. So I iterated. I removed parts that make it preachy, and I added parts that make it reflect uncertainty.
Anna: When you say you use it three to four times per week, is it scheduled or more reactive?
Amir: Both. I try to do it Sunday evening, like planning week. And then one or two times midweek when I feel stuck. And sometimes after something triggers me, like a rejection email, or a weird meeting. Then I use it to process.
Anna: Walk me through a full session from start to end, including how you save outputs.
Amir: Okay. So, step one: I open a note on my laptop where I write a quick raw dump, like, what happened, what I feel. Step two: I paste a cleaned version to AI. Step three: I ask it to mirror and find assumptions. Then it responds. I read it slowly. Sometimes I feel resistance, like, no, that is not it. Then I reply with corrections. Step four: I ask it to generate principles or trade-offs. Step five: I choose one principle that feels true, and I write it in my personal decision log.
Anna: You have a decision log.
Amir: Yes. In Notion. Very German of me. It is like, date, topic, options, principle, next step. And I tag it, like visa, career, identity, relationships. Then, over days, I cross-check. Like, if on Monday I think I want stability, and on Thursday I think I want autonomy, I compare. I ask, is this mood-driven or value-driven.
Anna: How do you cross-check with AI across multiple sessions?
Amir: I do two things. One is consistency check. I ask AI, based on what I wrote last time, what changed. But I do not fully trust its memory, because it may not have the context unless I paste it. So I paste the key points. Second, I do triangulation. I talk to a friend, or I write alone without AI. If the principle still holds, then I accept it.
Anna: What does conditional trust mean for you in this AI context?
Amir: It means I trust it as a thinking tool, not an authority. So I trust the process when it helps me see patterns, but I do not trust the content as truth. Like, if it says, the job market is great, I would laugh. It does not know my reality. But if it says, you seem to prioritize safety but also fear stagnation, that can be true. So I trust it for mirroring and structuring, not for facts or predictions.
Anna: What makes it feel trustworthy in those moments?
Amir: Internal coherence. Like if it can restate my situation accurately. If it catches contradictions gently. If it shows uncertainty, like, this could be one interpretation, not definitive. Also, if it helps name emotions without making me feel stupid. Like, it can say, it sounds like grief or fear, and I am like, yes. And it does not require me to perform confidence. With humans, I often perform. With AI, I can write, I am scared, and it is fine.
Anna: That non-judgmental aspect seems important.
Amir: Very important. Because I come from a culture where you have pride, you do not show weakness too much. And also as an immigrant, you always want to appear capable. The AI is like, okay, you can be messy here.
Anna: Can you share a vivid example of a value conflict session, like stability versus autonomy, or prestige versus learning versus visa security?
Amir: Yes. There was one in October. I had two opportunities. One was an interview process with a big company, like a well-known German brand, maybe automotive supply chain. It was a UX research internship that could lead to a job. It would be stable and looks good. The other was a smaller startup in Berlin, remote-first, doing a product I find interesting. They offered a working student role now and maybe a junior role later, but uncertain.
Anna: And what was the conflict?
Amir: The conflict was prestige and visa security versus learning and autonomy. The big company is like, you get structure, you get brand, maybe easier to justify for visa, and more stable salary. But the work might be slower, more bureaucracy, more German language, also. The startup is like, fast learning, more autonomy, English, but risk. And I was stuck. I was ruminating. Like, if I choose wrong, I waste time. That is catastrophic for me.
Anna: What did you ask the AI in that session?
Amir: I started with, I feel like I am optimizing three different things and they conflict. Then I used my prompt, mirror assumptions, biases. The AI mirrored and said, you assume stability equals safety, but you also assume autonomy equals identity fulfillment. It listed biases like, status quo bias, because I am leaning to big company because it feels safe. Also scarcity mindset, because visa makes me fear losing options. And then it asked questions like, what does stability mean concretely, is it contract length, is it learning structure, is it social belonging.
Anna: What did you notice emotionally as you read that?
Amir: I noticed tightness. Like in my chest. Because it made it real. It was not abstract anymore. I realized I am afraid of being forced to leave. And also I realized I am afraid of losing myself in bureaucracy. So it is like two fears.
Anna: And what decision principle came out?
Amir: The principle was something like, in the next two years, prioritize options that increase visa safety while still giving me skill growth that is transferable. That is a compromise principle. It is not prestige. It is not pure learning. It is, increase safety and transferability.
Anna: How did you apply that principle?
Amir: I used it to decide my thesis framing too. I chose a thesis that is relevant to industry, like AI-supported reflection in work contexts, but still has research rigor. So I can apply for UX research roles and also for research assistant roles. And then, for the job decision, I did not fully decide only by that principle. I still talked to my friend. But it reduced my anxiety.
Anna: That sounds like a moment where AI truly helped.
Amir: Yes. It created a coherent self-narrative. Like, I am not inconsistent, I am balancing constraints. It made me feel less shame. Like, I am not cowardly for wanting stability. It is rational.
Anna: Could you describe another moment where AI helped you take a concrete step?
Amir: Yes. In December I got a rejection from a company after a good interview. I was devastated. I wrote to AI, I feel like I will never get a job, I am behind. Then it did something useful: it reframed it as evidence that I can pass interviews, and it helped me create a post-mortem template. Like, what went well, what could improve, what is in my control. Then I did that, and I sent a message to the interviewer asking for feedback, in German. I would not do that without the emotional regulation. Because I would just hide.
Anna: So it reduced rumination and supported action.
Amir: Exactly.
Anna: Now, can you give me an example where AI did not help?
Amir: Oh yes. Many. One is when I get into over-intellectualizing. Like, I ask it to generate frameworks, and then it gives me five frameworks, and then I feel more overwhelmed. It is like, I wanted clarity and I get a menu. Another is when it gives confident but shallow answers, like, you should network, you should set goals. That is like, okay, thanks. And sometimes it can create false certainty. Like, it can write a very coherent narrative that feels good, but it might be too neat. And that can be dangerous. Because life is messy.
Anna: Can you recall a specific session where it felt safe but was not effective, meaning trusted but not effective?
Amir: Yes. There was a session after a conflict with my team. I felt misunderstood in a meeting. I used AI to vent. It mirrored my feelings very nicely, it validated, it named emotions. I felt calm. So I trusted it emotionally. But then it did not produce a next step. I ended the session feeling soothed but still stuck. It was like a warm blanket but no map. So trusted, yes. Effective, not really, because I did not act.
Anna: That is a clear distinction. Now the other direction: effective but not fully trusted. Do you have an example where the output was useful but you still did not fully trust it?
Amir: Yes. Sometimes it generates a decision principle that is very elegant. Like, prioritize learning velocity over brand. And I am like, that sounds cool, very Silicon Valley. It can be effective in giving me a language to think, but I do not trust it because it might be biased toward certain narratives, like hustle culture. So I take the structure but I validate with my real constraints. I ask, does this fit visa, finances, mental health. So it is effective as a tool, not trusted as a worldview.
Anna: What about privacy discomfort, does that ever show up?
Amir: Yes. That is another limit. Sometimes I write something and then I think, okay, where does this go. Like, I am not writing illegal things, but still, it is personal. And then I get uncomfortable. So I sometimes abstract. I do not write exact company name, I write my workplace. I also do not write exact numbers. And sometimes I choose to journal offline instead. So the trust is conditional also because of privacy.
Anna: If you had to rate your trust in AI tools for these kinds of career and identity reflections, 0 to 10, what would you say?
Amir: I would say 8.
Anna: Why 8 and not 10?
Amir: Because there are still hallucinations and overconfidence. Also privacy. Also it can be generic. But overall, for my use case, it is consistent and helpful.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for your situation, 0 to 10?
Amir: I would say 8 as well, maybe 8.5 but okay, 8.
Anna: Why?
Amir: Because it helps me create coherent self-narratives and decision frameworks, and it reduces anxiety. But it cannot replace real-world constraints. It also cannot network for me, it cannot sponsor visa. So effectiveness is high in thinking, medium in execution.
Anna: You said you do not use AI mainly for CVs. Can you explain why?
Amir: Yes. For CVs, I can do it myself, and also I do not fully trust it to understand German job culture. Also CV is like surface. My main struggle is not wording. My struggle is decision making and identity. So I use AI where it is strongest for me: structured reflection, asking questions, mirroring. For CV, I prefer to ask my lead researcher or friends.
Anna: How does your HCI mindset shape how you interact with AI?
Amir: I think of it as an interface. Like, the output is influenced by my input. So I try to design prompts like affordances. Like, I want it to ask me questions, so I tell it to ask. I want it to show uncertainty, so I ask it to present alternatives. Also I notice when it is leading me. Like, it can subtly push a narrative. So I try to make it symmetrical, like, show me multiple interpretations, show bias, do not moralize.
Anna: Do you ever feel you get dependent?
Amir: That is a fear. Sometimes I think, if I always process with AI, will I lose my own ability. But then I see it more like training wheels. It helps me learn how to structure. And sometimes I stop using it for a week to see. I can still think. So I do not feel addicted, but it is a tool I like.
Anna: When you stop for a week, what changes?
Amir: I ruminate more. I talk more to friends. But friends are busy. And I also feel more alone. AI is always available. That is a huge thing. For international students, loneliness is real. And AI fills some gap, not socially, but cognitively and emotionally.
Anna: That is an important point.
Amir: Yes. It is like, not companionship, but containment. Like a container for thoughts.
6. Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks
Anna: Now I want to compare human versus AI via specific career-related tasks. I will name a task, and you tell me which you would prefer and why. First task: clarifying career options, like industries or roles.
Amir: For clarifying options, AI is good for brainstorming and mapping. Like, it can list industries, roles, skill overlaps. But I do not trust it fully for local specifics. So I use AI to generate the space, then I validate with humans or job boards. Humans are better for realistic insider knowledge, like, in Cologne this company hires, or, this role expects German. AI can be too abstract.
Anna: Second task: making a high-stakes decision, like choosing between offers.
Amir: For high-stakes, I want hybrid. AI helps structure criteria and emotions. Human helps reality check and maybe emotional support. If I had a coach I trust, I would use them there. But because I do not have one, I use friends.
Anna: Third task: planning concrete next steps, like a job search strategy for three months.
Amir: AI is great for planning, like, weekly plan, track applications, build portfolio. But again, it can be generic. So I use it to propose a plan, then I edit. Human can hold accountability better. AI cannot really shame you, which is good and bad. It is good because no judgment, but sometimes I need pressure.
Anna: Fourth task: preparing for interviews.
Amir: AI for mock questions and structuring answers, yes. But for vibe and cultural nuance, humans. Like in Germany, the way you talk about yourself is different. AI can help, but a human recruiter or friend helps more.
Anna: Fifth task: dealing with anxiety or self-doubt after rejections.
Amir: AI, definitely. Because I can be messy, I can write at 1 am. It helps me name emotions. Humans I do not want to bother always. Also humans can give you their own anxiety. AI is stable.
Anna: Any task where you strongly prefer human?
Amir: When it is about social context, like office politics, or negotiating salary, or reading between lines. AI can give advice, but humans know reality. Also when it is about belonging, like, am I welcome in this team. AI cannot feel the vibe.
Anna: Any task where you strongly prefer AI?
Amir: When it is about internal conflict, identity, values. Because humans can judge, even if they do not want to. AI is safer. Also it is structured. Humans can be chaotic.
Anna: That is a nice contrast.
7. Trust–effectiveness link
Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness in your experience. When you think about AI tools, how does trust affect whether it is effective?
Amir: Trust is like, permission to use it deeply. If I do not trust it, I will not tell it the real thing. And then it will give generic advice. So trust increases depth of input, which increases quality of output. Also if I trust it as a process, I will follow the steps, like check assumptions, generate principles. That makes it effective.
Anna: And when trust is low, what happens?
Amir: I become defensive. Like, it says something and I am like, no, you do not understand. Then I stop. Or I use it only for shallow things. Then it is not effective for deep decisions.
Anna: Can you think of a moment where the AI output could have been effective but you did not trust it enough to use it?
Amir: Yes. When it gave me advice about negotiating a contract. It was probably good advice, like, ask for clarity, ask for written terms. But I did not trust it because I felt it does not know German legal culture. So I did not act. I asked my friend instead. So even if it was effective in theory, lack of trust reduced effectiveness.
Anna: And the other way: can trust itself make something feel effective even when the practical outcome is limited?
Amir: Yes. Like the warm blanket session. I trusted it emotionally, it felt safe. That reduced stress, so in that sense it was effective for emotional regulation, but not effective for action. So it depends what effectiveness means. If effectiveness is less anxiety, then it was effective. If effectiveness is decision, then no.
Anna: When you think about human coaching, how does trust affect effectiveness there?
Amir: Even more. Because with humans, if I do not trust, I will not share real fears. I will perform. Then the coach will coach the performance, not the reality. So trust is a gate. But also, with humans, trust takes time. With AI, trust is more immediate because it is non-judgmental by default, at least in feeling.
Anna: Interesting. What are your indicators that something is effective, either AI or human?
Amir: Clear decision principles. Like a sentence I can reuse later. Also a coherent self-story, like, I can explain to myself why I choose something. Also concrete next steps. And less anxiety, like my body feels calmer. And better conversations with humans. Like, I can talk to my lead researcher and not be chaotic, because I already structured my thoughts with AI.
Anna: That last point is important. Can you give an example?
Amir: Yes. I had a meeting with my lead researcher about my future. Before the meeting I used AI to clarify what I want to ask. I wrote, I want feedback on my readiness for junior role, and what gaps. The AI helped me generate a structured agenda. Then in the meeting, I was clear. She responded better. So the AI indirectly improved a human interaction.
Anna: So effectiveness can be downstream.
Amir: Exactly. It is like a scaffold.
8. Preferences and hybrid model reaction
Anna: Now I want to ask about your preferences. If you could design an ideal support system for career decisions, what would it look like?
Amir: It would be hybrid. AI for preparation, reflection, and follow-up. Human for pivotal moments. Like, AI helps me clarify what I feel and what I want. Then human helps with contextual advice and accountability. Then AI helps me integrate after the human session, like, what did I learn, what principle, what next steps.
Anna: What would you want the AI to do, specifically, in a hybrid model?
Amir: First, help me articulate the problem before I talk to a coach. Like, a pre-coaching intake, but intelligent. Second, help me generate questions for the coach. Third, after the coach, help me translate insights into actions and principles. Also keep a memory of my principles over time, but with privacy controls.
Anna: And what would you want the human to do?
Amir: Validate reality. Like, tell me what is realistic in Germany, in UX research. Also give me emotional presence when it is heavy. AI is safe but it is not real empathy. And the human can hold me accountable. Like, you said you will do this, did you do it. AI can remind, but it is not the same.
Anna: If you heard about a platform that combines AI-guided exploration with access to human insiders or coaches, how would you react?
Amir: I would be interested, but I would ask, how do you match me with the human. Because trust depends on fit. If you match me with someone who does not understand international constraints, I will not trust. Also I would ask, what happens to my data. And I would want the AI to be transparent about limits. Like, do not pretend to be a therapist. Also, I would want pricing that makes sense for a student.
Anna: What would make you trust such a hybrid platform?
Amir: Clear boundaries. Like, what AI does, what human does. Also evidence that the insiders are real, verified. And maybe some kind of quality signal, like reviews, but also not fake. And also, the platform should not push me to a path that benefits them. Like, conflict of interest.
Anna: If you had to choose one mode for the next six months, only AI or only human, what would you choose?
Amir: Only AI, honestly, because of access and my habit. But I would miss the human reality check. So I would probably build it through friends.
Anna: That is clear.
Amir: But if I had a really good coach who understands my context, then maybe only human. But that is hypothetical.
Anna: What is your biggest hesitation about AI in career coaching contexts?
Amir: Overconfidence and generic advice. And privacy. Also, if it becomes too persuasive, like it pushes a narrative, then it can manipulate. I do not like that. I want autonomy.
Anna: And your biggest hesitation about human coaching?
Amir: Cost. And judgment. And mismatch. And sometimes humans can be biased, consciously or not.
Anna: Do you think your preference will change as you become more stable, like after you get a job?
Amir: Yes. I think when visa pressure reduces, I may be more open to exploring identity without urgency. Then human coaching could become more valuable. Right now I need speed and structure. Later I may need depth and relational support.
9. Closing
Anna: We are coming to the end. Is there anything important about your experience with AI or human career support that we did not cover?
Amir: I guess no we are good. 
Anna: Thank you. And final check, are you okay with everything we discussed being used anonymously for research purposes?
Amir: Yes, that is fine.
Anna: Great. Thank you for your time, Amir. I really appreciate your openness.
Amir: Thanks Anna. It was interesting. Also for my thesis, it is funny.
Anna: Yes. Okay, I will stop the


Laura


1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Laura. Thanks for joining. Before we start, do I have your permission to record? Everything will be anonymised. You can skip any question, and you can stop anytime.
Laura: Yes, I consent. You can record.
Anna: Thank you. Just to confirm, this is for a master thesis about trust and perceived effectiveness in AI-based career coaching versus human coaching, with early-career people in Germany. I will ask about your experiences and perceptions. Any topics you prefer not to discuss?
Laura: Um, no, it is fine. Maybe just no very detailed numbers about my salary. But otherwise okay.
Anna: Perfect. We can keep it high level. And if anything feels too specific, we can move on. Are you comfortable speaking mostly in English?
Laura: Yes. My English is fine. And sometimes I might put a German word because Frankfurt is like that. 
Anna: Totally fine. Okay, let’s start.
2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: To begin, where are you currently in your career, and what career decisions or questions are you facing or recently faced?
Laura: Eehm. So I am 27. I am from Spain originally, and I have been in Germany for six years now. I live in Frankfurt. I work in a bank as a data and finance analyst. It is a bit of a hybrid role, like I sit between finance controlling and data analytics, so I do reporting, dashboards, forecasting, and also like ad hoc analysis when stakeholders ask something last minute.  And the big decision I faced, like in the last six months especially, was whether I stay in finance and go deeper, like try to get promoted, or if I move to a climate mission startup, like a climate fintech or a climate analytics company, or if I apply for a Master track or even PhD track in something like sustainable finance or climate economics.
Anna: And when you say big decision, what made it feel high-stakes for you?
Laura: Um, multiple things. One is that Frankfurt banking culture is intense. Like the prestige logic is real. It is like, if you leave, people assume you could not handle it or you are not ambitious. And I am an international, even if I am EU, I still feel that pressure to prove myself. Another thing is money and stability. I have a good salary, I can live alone, I can save, I can travel to Spain. If I go to a startup, the pay might be lower, and also the risk is higher, like they can fail. And then the third option, academia, it is like identity. I have this voice in my head, like you are smart, you should do research, you should do a PhD, you should do something meaningful and deep. But then I also know academia is stressful and uncertain. Funding, supervision, and like, you can feel very alone.
Anna: You mentioned you have been in Germany six years. What was your path to Frankfurt and to banking?
Laura: I did my Bachelor in Spain in Business Administration and Economics. In my last year I did an Erasmus in the Netherlands, and I liked the international environment. Then I applied for a Master in Germany. I did a Master in Finance and Data Analytics, like a program that was half finance, half data. It was in a different city first, not Frankfurt. After that I got an internship in Frankfurt and then a full-time offer. And Frankfurt is very, you know, bank-heavy. So it kind of happened.
Anna: What team are you in now, broadly? Like investment banking, retail, risk, something else?
Laura: Risk. Not the trading side. More like risk management and portfolio monitoring. I work with credit risk data, and also climate risk started to appear. So I do things like stress testing data preparation, and management reporting. It is not like front office glamour, but the pressure is still high because it goes to senior management. And because risk is like, no mistakes. In German they say, Fehlerkultur, but in banking it is like, no, there is no Fehlerkultur. 
Anna: That is a vivid line. What are your day-to-day stressors in that environment?
Laura: Deadlines. Like, there are cycles, month-end, quarter-end, and then special requests. And you cannot say no, because the stakeholder is like a director or someone. And also the culture is very, how to say, risk-averse and formal. So even if you do good work, you feel like it is never enough. And I have perfectionism. So I will check things five times. And then I also sometimes feel lonely because most people are German or have their network already. My German is okay, like B2-ish, but in meetings it is often German, and then they switch to English for me, and I feel like, ugh, I am the reason the meeting is slower. Even if nobody says it, you know.
Anna: That feeling of being the friction.
Laura: Exactly. And then also my family is in Spain. So if I have a hard week, it is not like I can just go for dinner with my parents. I have friends, but adult life, everyone is busy. So yes. So the decision felt high-stakes because it touches money, identity, mental health, and also like my future story. Like, who am I.
Anna: When did the decision become urgent?
Laura: Around September last year, so like four months ago. There was a reorg announcement. Not layoffs, but reorg. And my manager basically told me, there is an opportunity to take more responsibility, but it will be more pressure. And at the same time I was getting messages on LinkedIn from climate startups because my profile had climate risk keywords. And then, um, I had this moment where I thought, if I say yes now, I lock myself in for at least two more years, because leaving after getting responsibility looks bad. And I was already tired. So it became urgent.
3) Career support in general

Anna: When you need career support, who or what do you usually turn to?
Laura: Hmm. It changed. Earlier, like during my Master, I used university career services a bit, like CV review. Not so much for deep career decisions. Then at the bank, I sometimes talk to colleagues, like informal mentoring. And I talk to friends, like friends in consulting, friends in tech. And my sister in Spain, she is a psychologist, so she is good for emotional support, not career advice, but she helps me see patterns. And then, yes, I use AI. Like, very actively. Especially in this decision period, it became a big thing.
Anna: When you say career support, what do you mean you need? Is it information, structure, reassurance, something else?
Laura: All of it. But I think the hardest part is rumination. Like I can research forever. The internet gives you infinite stories. But then you still cannot decide. So support for me is, one, structure, and two, emotional containment, like someone to hold the anxiety without making it worse. And three, reality checks, like what is realistic in Germany, what is realistic in Frankfurt.
Anna: What has actually helped you historically, and what felt unhelpful?
Laura: Helpful is when someone asks me good questions. Like, not advice immediately. Like, why do you want this, what are you afraid of. Unhelpful is generic advice, like follow your passion. Or people projecting. Like a friend who hates corporate will say, just leave, corporate is evil. And a colleague who is very corporate will say, startups are chaos, you will regret. That is unhelpful.
Anna: And where does AI fit into that ecosystem for you?
Laura: In normal times, AI is like productivity. Like help me draft an email, summarise a report, or explain something technical. But in that three-week period, it became almost like a coach. Not in the emotional way, but in the decision structure way. And I did not expect that.
4) Human coaching: experience and trust

Anna: Let us talk about human coaching first. Have you ever had career coaching, like a professional coach, or something similar?
Laura: Not really professional. I had one short session with a coach that my bank offered, like an internal program, but it was more like career development talk. It was 45 minutes. And she was nice, but it was very surface. And then I had informal mentoring with a senior colleague, like coffee chats. But not like a structured coaching relationship.
Anna: Can you tell me about that one session? What was it like?
Laura: It was on Teams. The coach was external but hired by the bank. She asked about my goals, and I said, I am not sure if I want to stay. And she immediately tried to put it into a framework, like strengths, opportunities. Which is okay, but I felt she did not understand my context. Like Frankfurt risk teams have a very specific culture. And also she did not know me, so in 45 minutes, it is hard. I left feeling, okay, she is supportive, but I still do not know what to do. So it was trusted in the sense she was kind, but it was not effective for my situation.
Anna: That is an important distinction. We can come back to that. What about informal mentoring? Any episode that stands out?
Laura: Yes. I had a coffee with a director in another team, a woman, and she was very honest. She told me, if you want to move internally to a more climate-related risk team, you need sponsors, you need visibility, and you need to play the game a bit. And I appreciated that because it was concrete and realistic. I trusted her competence because she knows the bank. But also, she is inside the system, so she also had bias, like she wants people to stay.
Anna: When you think about trust in a human coach or mentor, what drives that trust for you?
Laura: Competence and context understanding. Like do they understand Germany, the labour market, also cultural things. Second is confidentiality. Like, if it is internal coaching, I am never 100 percent sure it is confidential. Third is empathy, but not like pity. More like, they can sit with ambiguity. And also structure. Like they have a process. If it is just vibes, I do not trust it.
Anna: And what would make you distrust a human coach?
Laura: If they push their agenda. If they talk too much about themselves. If they make big claims, like I can guarantee you will find your purpose in two sessions. That feels like marketing. And if they are not transparent about pricing and boundaries. Also if they judge. Like, if they say, why are you so ungrateful, you have a good job. That would shut me down.
5) AI tools: experience and trust

Anna: Now let us go into AI tools. You already mentioned a three-week period. Can you walk me through how that started?
Laura: Yes. It started very practically. I had a Sunday where I could not relax. I was on the couch, and I was scrolling LinkedIn and reading about climate jobs and reading about PhDs. And my brain was like a browser with 50 tabs. And I thought, okay, I need to do something structured. And I opened ChatGPT. I had used it before for work, but not for life decisions. And I wrote something like, help me structure a decision between three paths: staying in banking, moving to a climate startup, or doing a Master or PhD. And it responded with a framework, like criteria, scoring, scenario planning. And I was like, okay, this is actually what I need.
Anna: How often did you use it during those three weeks?
Laura: A lot. Like daily. Some days maybe one hour total, some days just ten minutes. But it was consistent. It became like, after work, I open it, I dump my thoughts, and I ask it to reflect back. And I did it for three weeks intensively, then it reduced.
Anna: What made it feel coaching-like for you, as opposed to just a tool?
Laura: Two things. One, it forced me to make trade-offs explicit. Like, I could not just say, I want stability and meaning and money and learning. It was like, okay, choose weights. And that was painful. And two, it mirrored my avoidance. Like it would say, you are listing pros and cons but you are not stating what you value most, or you are using uncertainty as a reason to delay. And I was like, ugh, that is true. It felt like someone calling me out, but without judgement. That is coaching-like.
Anna: Can you describe the decision model you built, in concrete terms?
Laura: Yes. So I defined five criteria. Learning and growth, values alignment, residency and stability, financial runway, and mental health. And then I assigned weights. I did not do it alone, I did it with AI. It suggested a starting point, then I adjusted.
Anna: What weights did you end up with?
Laura: I ended with learning at 25 percent, values alignment at 25 percent, stability at 20 percent, financial runway at 15 percent, and mental health at 15 percent.
Anna: And what did stability mean for you specifically, given you are an EU citizen?
Laura: Good question. It is not visa in the strict sense. It is more like, job security, ability to pay rent, and also my long-term plan to maybe apply for German citizenship. Like, I know as EU I can live here, but citizenship is still a thing I considered for identity and for like, feeling settled. Also stability is like, probation period risk. In a startup you have probation and it can end fast. In a bank it is stable. In academia, it is like, contracts, stipends, very uncertain.
Anna: Okay. And then how did you use those criteria?
Laura: I built a scoring table. Like each path gets a score from 1 to 10 on each criterion, then multiplied by the weight. But the AI also pushed me to do scenarios, not just one score, because each path has multiple versions.
Anna: Yes, tell me please about the scenarios.
Laura: For staying in finance, I had three scenarios. One was stay in my current team and take that extra responsibility. Two was move internally to a climate risk related team, like within the bank, if possible. Three was stay but negotiate boundaries, like less overtime, which is hard but possible. For climate startup, I had, one, join an early-stage startup with lower pay but high mission and learning. Two, join a scale-up, like Series B, more stable, but maybe more corporate already. Join a climate consultancy or climate data vendor, like still mission but more stable. For academia, I had, one, do a Master in sustainable finance, like a second Master, which is expensive and time. Two, apply directly for a PhD in Germany, maybe funded. Three, do part-time research while staying in the bank, which is like unrealistic but I included it.
Anna: And did you actually research real programs and real startups, or was it hypothetical?
Laura: Both. The scenarios started abstract. Then in week two, it became concrete. I started listing specific companies and specific programs. But I was careful, I did not put confidential bank information. And I also did not put full company names sometimes. I would write like, climate fintech, Frankfurt, 50 people. Because privacy.
Anna: What were your trust drivers for AI in this process? What made you trust it enough to use it as a decision partner?
Laura: Structure and consistency. Like it does not get tired. It can hold the whole model and remember the weights. Also the ability to mirror assumptions. Like it would say, you assume startup equals meaning, but is that always true. And forcing explicit trade-offs. And no judgement. With humans, I sometimes feel judged, like, why would you leave a good job. With AI, I can say anything, even contradictions, and it just works with it.
Anna: And what were distrust drivers?
Laura: Mistakes. Sometimes it would say things with confidence that were not true, like a statistic or a program detail. So I learned to verify. Also generic advice. Sometimes it would become like LinkedIn motivational. And missing context, like it cannot feel the Frankfurt culture. It can approximate, but not fully. And privacy concerns. Like, where does this data go, who sees it. So I never shared too personal or identifiable details. And also biased framing. Sometimes it pushes optimisation logic, like maximise learning, but humans are not spreadsheets. So I had to correct.
Anna: Can you give an example of something that was effective but not fully trusted?
Laura: Yes. It suggested salary ranges for climate roles and also suggested which German cities have more climate startups. It was useful as a starting point, but I did not trust it. I went to reality checks, like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, talking to people, and also job ads. So it was effective in giving me hypotheses, but trust was partial.
Anna: And an example of something you trusted but it was not effective?
Laura: Hmm. In AI? Or in general?
Anna: In general, either human or AI, as long as you make it explicit.
Laura: Human. My friend in Barcelona. I called her crying, like not crisis, but overwhelmed. And she was very supportive. She told me, you are brave, you will figure it out, you deserve happiness. I trusted her emotionally. It felt very good. But after the call, I still had no plan. So it was trusted but not effective for decision execution.
Anna: That is very clear. Now, can you describe how the AI outputs evolved over the three weeks? Like, what did you produce?
Laura: Week one was frameworks and criteria. Like, define values, define weights, build a scoring table. Week two was scenarios and risk analysis. It asked me to list risks, and then mitigations. It also helped me draft outreach messages to people. Week three was the decision memo. I wrote a one-page memo. The AI helped me structure it. It was like a real consulting deliverable, which is funny. 
Anna: Tell me about that memo. What did it contain?
Laura: It had a headline decision statement at the top, like, I will move to a climate mission-driven role in the next three months, targeting scale-ups, while keeping a backup plan of internal move if offers do not materialise. Something like that. Then rationale, like values and learning and mental health. Then risks, like financial risk, skill gap, identity risk, like leaving prestige. Then mitigations, like keep savings, upskill in climate data, talk to mentors, set timeline, and also like, if no offer by date, reconsider. And then next steps, like outreach list, applications, and a weekly plan.
Anna: And what was the final decision, in the end?
Laura: I chose the climate startup path. Specifically, I joined a climate risk analytics scale-up. It is not like 5 people in a garage. It is around 120 people, offices in Germany, and they sell software to banks and insurers. So it is climate mission but still connected to my finance background. And I accepted an offer starting in March. So yes, that is the final.
Anna: Congratulations. What made that the winning option compared to staying or academia?
Laura: The weighted model showed it clearly. Values alignment and learning were high, mental health was better, stability was okay because it is a scale-up not super early. Financial runway was lower than bank, but still acceptable. And the biggest thing was, I realised I was using academia as an escape fantasy. Like, oh, if I do a PhD, I do not have to decide between corporate and mission because I can be intellectual. But the AI kept asking, what is your actual goal. Do you want research, or do you want meaning. And I realised I want meaning and impact, not necessarily academia.
Anna: That moment sounds important. Can you describe a specific moment when AI surfaced an avoidance for you?
Laura: Yes. There was a prompt it asked me. I asked it to help me decide, and it said something like, what are you protecting by not deciding. And I wrote, I am protecting my identity as someone who made the safe choice and the prestigious choice. If I leave, I lose the story. And then it asked, what is the cost of keeping that story. And I wrote, burnout, loneliness, cynicism. And when I saw it in text, it was like, okay, I cannot unsee it. That was a real coaching moment.
Anna: And a moment where AI did not help?
Laura: Yes. Sometimes it pushed premature clarity. Like I would write, I feel scared, and it would respond with, then choose the option that maximises your weighted score. And I was like, yes, but I am a human. It could not hold the fear. It can label it, but not contain it. And sometimes it created false certainty. Like, you could get an offer in four weeks, just do these steps. And in reality, hiring cycles are slow. So I had to ground it.
Anna: During those three weeks, did you also talk to humans? Or was it mostly AI?
Laura: I did both. But AI was like the backbone. Humans were like emotional support and reality check. I talked to my sister, I talked to two friends, and I talked to one colleague who had moved from bank to fintech. And those conversations were important. Like, my sister helped me not panic. My friend helped me feel less alone. And the colleague helped me with practical things like, negotiate contract, what to ask. So it was hybrid already.
Anna: You said you used AI intensively for three weeks. Did you use it in a specific way, like journaling, or like Q and A?
Laura: Both. I had sessions where I just brain-dumped. Like, here are my thoughts, reflect them back, ask me questions. And then I had sessions where I asked for deliverables. Like, build a decision matrix, draft a message, draft a memo, generate scenarios. And I also used it to rehearse conversations, like with my manager.
Anna: Did that rehearsal actually influence what you said in real conversations?
Laura: Yes. I had to tell my manager that I am exploring. I did not want to say, I am leaving, too early. But I wanted to set boundaries. The AI helped me phrase it in a professional way. And I did it. And it reduced my anxiety because I had rehearsed.
Anna: That is an effectiveness indicator in itself. We will come back.
6) Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: I would like to compare human and AI support via concrete tasks. I will name a task and you tell me what works better, and why, based on your experience. First task clarifying options. Like, generating possible paths.
Laura: AI is better for breadth. It can generate many options quickly, and it does not get bored. Humans are better for filtering based on knowing you. But if the human does not know you well, AI is more useful.
Anna: Second task making trade-offs explicit, like choosing criteria and weights.
Laura: AI, surprisingly. Because it forced me to write numbers. Humans sometimes avoid numbers because it feels too rational. But in my case, the numbers helped me see what I actually value.
Anna: Third task reality check about the labour market in Germany, like what is realistic in Frankfurt, hiring cycles, cultural things.
Laura: Humans. Definitely humans. Because they have lived experience. AI can summarise general patterns, but Frankfurt banking is very specific. Like the prestige and risk culture. Humans can tell you, yes, your manager will react like this. Or, in startups, probation is like this. That was human.
Anna: Fourth task emotional support when you feel overwhelmed.
Laura: Human. No question. AI can say supportive words, but it feels like, eehm, empty. Not always, but often. Human voice, human presence, it calms your nervous system.
Anna: Fifth task building an action plan, like timelines, outreach list, risk mitigations.
Laura: AI is very good. Because it can turn chaos into steps. And then humans can validate the steps. So AI creates the plan, human makes it realistic and also holds you accountable.
Anna: Can you give an example of the outreach list you mentioned?
Laura: Yes. I created a list of around 18 people. Some were LinkedIn connections, some were second-degree, some were alumni. I grouped them by category, like people in climate risk, people in climate fintech, people in academia. And I wrote short messages. The AI helped me draft the messages in a way that is polite in Germany. Like, not too direct, not too long. And then I actually sent them.
Anna: How many responses did you get?
Laura: Maybe 10 responded. And I had 6 calls. And two of those calls directly led to interview processes. So the plan was executed, not just theoretical.
Anna: That seems like strong perceived effectiveness.
Laura: Yes. It reduced rumination. Instead of thinking, I was doing.
Anna: Another task is  preparing for a difficult conversation, like with your manager or with HR.
Laura: AI again. It is like a simulator. You can practice, you can ask, what might they say, and how do I respond. It gave me scripts. But I still adapted in real life.
Anna: And task of exploring deeper values and identity, like who you want to be.
Laura: This one is mixed. AI helped because it asked structured questions and reflected patterns. But humans help because they know my history and they can challenge me emotionally, like, you always do this. AI can too, but it is more cognitive.
Anna: When you think about trust in these tasks, does your trust differ by task?
Laura: Yes. For emotional tasks, I do not trust AI fully. For structure tasks, I trust AI more. But I trust it with conditions. Like I trust it to help me think, not to tell me the truth. If that makes sense.
Anna: Yes. Trust as appropriate reliance, not blind belief I agree.
Laura: Exactly.
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to explore the link between trust and effectiveness. In your experience, how does trust affect whether something is effective?
Laura: Um. Trust is like permission. If I trust the tool or the person, I will share the real problem, not the polite version. And then the output is better. With AI, I trusted it enough to be honest about my fears and contradictions. But I also limited what I share because of privacy. So trust is partial. And effectiveness was still high because for my decision, I needed structure more than deep emotional disclosure. If I needed therapy-level support, trust would be different.
Anna: So effectiveness can be high even with partial trust, depending on the task.
Laura: Yes. Exactly. For example, I did not fully trust it on facts, like salary numbers. But it was still effective because it made me clearer and it pushed me to take action. So trust and effectiveness are related but not identical.
Anna: And what about the opposite? Can you have trust but low effectiveness?
Laura: Yes. Like the coaching session at the bank. I trusted she was kind. I trusted she meant well. But it was not effective because it was generic and not contextual. Also sometimes friends. I trust them, but they cannot give structure or they just say, you will be fine. That is emotionally nice but not effective for decision.
Anna: How did your trust in AI develop over the three weeks? Was it immediate or gradual?
Laura: Gradual. The first day, I was skeptical. I thought, it will give generic advice. Then it surprised me with good questions. Then I started using it more. Then I had one hallucination moment, like it told me something about a German program that was wrong. And that reduced trust. But I adapted by verifying. So trust became like calibrated. Not more or less, but smarter.
Anna: Can you describe that hallucination moment?
Laura: Yes. I asked about a specific scholarship option for a Master in Germany. It gave me a confident answer about eligibility and deadlines. And then I checked and it was wrong. And I felt, okay, this can mislead. In high stakes decisions, that is dangerous. So I learned to not rely on it for factual details without checking.
Anna: So your trust drivers became, it is good for reasoning, not for authoritative facts.
Laura: Yes. Reasoning and structure, yes. Facts, verify. And also privacy, be careful.
Anna: When you reflect on perceived effectiveness, what are your indicators? How did you know it was effective, not just engaging?
Laura: Clarity. Like, I could say, this is my priority order. I could articulate trade-offs. Decision confidence. Not like 100 percent, but enough. Action plan execution. Like, I actually did the outreach and interviews. Reduced rumination. Like, my mind was calmer. And better conversations with humans. Because I came to them with a structured story, not chaos. That made humans more helpful too.
Anna: That last one is interesting. AI enabling better human conversations.
Laura: Yes. Because humans get tired if you are messy. Like, you call a friend and you are like, I do not know, I do not know, and after 20 minutes they are like, okay. But if you say, I have three paths, here is what I value, can you help me reality-check this one risk, then the conversation is productive.
Anna: That is a very concrete mechanism.
Laura: Yes.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction

Anna: I will now ask you to do a short micro-poll, just quick ratings. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is no trust at all and 10 is complete trust, how would you rate your trust in human career coaches, broadly?
Laura: Hmm. For human career coaches, I would say 6.5. Maybe 7. Because I think humans can be very good, but I have not had enough experience to trust blindly. And also there are many coaches with different quality.
Anna: What drives that 6.5 or 7, and what prevents it from being higher?
Laura: Drives it higher is empathy, context, and accountability. Prevents it is uncertainty about competence and agenda. Like, are they actually good, or is it marketing. And also cost. Like if you pay a lot, you want results, but results are not guaranteed. So trust is cautious.
Anna: Same scale, trust in AI tools for career support.
Laura: For AI, I would say 7.5. But it is weird. Because I trust it in a different way. I trust its process, not its truth. So I give it 7.5 because it was consistent and helpful, but it is not like I trust it with my life.
Anna: What keeps it from being higher?
Laura: Hallucinations, privacy, and lack of real-world accountability. Like, it can say anything. There is no consequence. A human coach has reputation. AI does not care. Also it can miss emotional context.
Anna: Now perceived effectiveness. On 0 to 10, how effective do you think human coaching would be for your specific situation, that three-path decision?
Laura: If it is a good coach, it could be 8. But based on my actual experience, I would rate 5.5. Because I did not have a strong human coaching relationship. So in practice, it did not move the decision.
Anna: And perceived effectiveness of AI tools for that situation?
Laura: For my situation, I would say 9. Honestly. It enabled the final decision and action plan. It did not just make me faster, it made me clearer.
Anna: What would have made it a 10?
Laura: If it could hold emotions better. Like, if it could help with fear without becoming generic. And if it could guarantee factual accuracy or show sources. Then I would trust more and it would be even more effective.
Anna: Thank you. That took about a minute, perfect.
Anna: Now, thinking about your preferences, if you could design the ideal support model for a person like you in that situation, would it be human-only, AI-only, or hybrid?
Laura: Hybrid. Definitely hybrid. AI for preparation, structure, and follow-up. Human for emotional containment, accountability, and maybe like one or two key sessions to challenge blind spots.
Anna: Can you describe what hybrid would look like, concretely, like over a few weeks?
Laura: Yes. Week one, AI helps you map options, values, criteria. Then you meet a human coach to talk about emotional stuff and identity, like what is behind the decision. Then AI helps you build scenarios and an action plan. Then a human helps you reality-check and also practice conversations. Then AI helps you with execution, like reminders, drafting outreach, tracking progress. And then a final human session to integrate and reflect.
Anna: How do you feel about the idea of a platform that combines human mentors or coaches with AI support, like AI to structure and humans to support emotionally?
Laura: It makes sense. Because the problem is, humans are expensive and not always available. And sometimes you do not need a human for everything. Like, I do not need to pay someone to build a matrix. But I would pay for someone to help me sit with fear and to see patterns. So hybrid is efficient.
Anna: What would you need to trust such a hybrid platform?
Laura: Transparency about what AI does and what humans do. Data protection. Like, where do my inputs go. Also quality control of the human side. Like, who are these mentors, are they trained, do they have ethics. And also boundaries. Like, do not pretend AI is a therapist. Be honest. If the platform is honest, I trust more.
Anna: What would make you hesitate?
Laura: If it feels like a black box. Or if it pushes me to share too much personal data. Or if the human is not good. Like one bad mentor can ruin trust. Also if the AI outputs are generic, then why use it. It needs to be personalised, but that conflicts with privacy. So that is a tension.
Anna: Yes, that trade-off. Personalisation versus privacy.
Laura: Exactly. And also, hmm, in Germany, people are sensitive about Datenschutz. I am Spanish, but living here, you absorb it.
9) Closing

Anna: Before we wrap up, is there anything you wish you had known before starting that three-week decision sprint?
Laura: I wish I knew that clarity is not a feeling, but rather a result of action. Like, I thought I need to feel sure, then act. But actually I acted, then I felt more sure. And AI helped me act. So I wish I had started earlier.
Anna: Any final thoughts on trust and effectiveness that you think are important?
Laura: No. 
Anna: Thank you, Laura. I will stop the recording now. 






Tobias


1) Opening and consent

Anna: Hi Tobias, can you hear me well?
Tobias: Yes, I can hear you. Um, yes, loud and clear.
Anna: Great. Thanks for joining. Before we start, a couple of quick points. This is a research interview about trust and perceived effectiveness in different kinds of career support, including human coaching and AI tools. It is voluntary. You can skip any question, and you can stop at any time. I will keep your identity anonymous and use a pseudonym. With your permission, I would like to record this for transcription. Is that okay?
Tobias: Yes, that is okay. Recording is fine.
Anna: Thank you. And just to double check, do you have any questions before we begin?
Tobias: Not really. I read the short info you sent. It is fine.
Anna: Perfect. I will start the recording now. Okay. So, to warm up, could you introduce yourself a bit. Whatever feels relevant for your career situation right now.
Tobias: Sure. Eehm, I am Tobias, well, pseudonym Tobias, I guess. I am 28. I was born in Germany, grew up in Baden Wurttemberg, and I live in Stuttgart. I work as a junior mechanical engineer in a mid size automotive supplier. Um, and I would say I am at that stage where I have, like, enough experience to see how things work, but not enough seniority to really influence it. That is kind of the whole issue.
Anna: Mm. Thank you. And you are comfortable speaking mostly English, with some German words if needed?
Tobias: Yes. I will probably mix sometimes, like, the German company words. Like Zielvereinbarung and so on.
Anna: Totally fine.
2) Participant context and career situation

Anna: Let us start with your context. What exactly do you do in your job day to day, and what kind of company is it?
Tobias: Okay. So, we are a supplier, not Tier 1 like the huge ones, but also not a tiny workshop. Maybe, like, 800 people. We do components for thermal management and some structural parts. I am in the development department, Konstruktion, but it is not pure CAD all day. It is, like, a mix. Um, I do design changes, tolerance analysis, and also support testing. Like, if a part fails in testing or if we have a customer issue, then we do root cause analysis, and I have to coordinate with testing, materials, sometimes with suppliers.
Anna: So it is design, plus troubleshooting, plus coordination.
Tobias: Exactly. And supplier coordination is the part I did not expect so much. Because at university it is, like, oh you design a thing. In reality it is, you design a thing, but then you talk to three people, and the supplier says, we cannot do that radius, and purchasing says, cost too high, and the customer says, we need it yesterday.
Anna: That sounds very familiar for automotive.
Tobias: Yes. And Stuttgart is, you know, very automotive. Everybody either works directly for OEMs or for suppliers, or your neighbor does. So the culture is quite, um, how to say, traditional. Hierarchy, titles, people care about who studied where, what your grade was, who is Dr. Ing. There is a lot of respect for expertise, which is good. But also it can be very rigid.
Anna: When did you start in this role?
Tobias: I joined the company about two and a half years ago. Before that I did my master at Hochschule, actually in the region, and I did internships, Werkstudent, at another supplier. So I did not come completely blind. But still, first full time job, first time being part of a project for real.
Anna: If you think about the last 6 to 12 months, what has been the biggest career decision or turning point for you?
Tobias:  Honestly, it was the decision to pay for a private career coach, and then to stop after the first session. And then, to replace that with, um, two things. One is using AI tools for reflection and preparation, and the other is asking a senior colleague to mentor me informally. That is the biggest shift. Because before, I thought, okay, I need a professional coach, like a structured thing. And now I am, like, skeptical, and I do it differently.
Anna: We will definitely go into that. Before we go there, can you describe what feeling stuck meant for you. Like, what did the recognition gap look like?
Tobias: Yes. So, the simple story is, I work a lot, I deliver, and I am still seen as, like, junior helper. That is the vibe. It is not that people are mean. It is more subtle. For example, in project meetings, I bring solutions, but then a senior engineer repeats it, and then it becomes the solution. Sorry, that sounds bitter, but it is true.
Anna: No need to filter. That is useful detail.
Tobias: Another thing is performance reviews. We have the annual review, Jahresgespraech, and there is this rating system. And you have Zielvereinbarung, and you get feedback like, you did a good job, keep going, but nothing concrete. I asked for more responsibility, like owning a module, or being the main contact for a subproject. And my manager said, yes, maybe next year, first prove yourself. And I was thinking, I am already proving myself for two years.
Anna: So, vague feedback, no clear pathway.
Tobias: Yes. And also compensation, like salary band. There are bands. And promotions are cautious. It is not like startups where you change title every year. Here it is, wait, wait, wait. Which is okay. But I wanted at least a development plan. Like, tell me what to do. And instead it was, be patient, and be visible. And I hate the word visible. Because it feels like politics.
Anna: Mm. What did you interpret as the main reason you were under recognized. Was it technical skill, communication, politics, or something else?
Tobias: It is a mix. Technically I am good, but maybe not, like, brilliant genius. But I think that is okay. I think the bigger issue is, I am not the loud guy. In meetings, I speak when I have something. I am not doing this, look at me. And in that culture, the loud ones are sometimes seen as more senior. Also, I do a lot of support work. Like, fixing issues, helping others, doing the unpleasant tasks. And that is important, but it is invisible. It is like, when everything works, nobody notices.
Anna: That is a very clear picture. In your mind, what were the options you were considering, before you booked coaching?
Tobias: I had three options. One, stay and just endure and hope it gets better. Two, move internally, like to testing or project management, maybe to get different visibility. Three, leave the company, maybe even leave the supplier world, or go into consulting, which everyone suggests in Stuttgart if you are ambitious. Like, oh you should do Beratung, you can earn more, and you see many projects.
Anna: And which of those felt attractive, and which felt wrong?
Tobias: Consulting felt wrong emotionally. Like, I respect it, but it is not me. I like building stuff, understanding a product deeply, improving it. The idea of, like, flying Monday to Thursday, making slides, telling others what to do, it felt like, not authentic. But I still had the thought because people kept saying it. Internal move was interesting, but also risky because then you lose technical path. Staying was safe but depressing. So I wanted clarity.
3. Career support in general

Anna: Before you went to private coaching, what kind of career support did you use in general. Mentors, friends, anything formal?
Tobias: Mostly informal. Friends from university, we talk. Sometimes my girlfriend, but she is in a different field, so it is more emotional support. I also talked to one former professor once, but it was a short call. And inside the company, there is something like mentoring program, but it is very, hm, formal, and you need approval. And I did not want to signal, like, I am unhappy. Also, you know, in German companies, people talk. Confidentiality is not always real, even if they say it.
Anna: That is important. So you did not use internal HR career services.
Tobias: Not really. HR is, in my perception, not for you, but for the company. That sounds cynical, but that is how it feels. They can help with forms, but not with, like, your personal strategy.
Anna: If you imagine ideal career support, what would it look like for you?
Tobias: I wanted someone who understands the industry context, like automotive supplier, and also understands personality differences. Like, not everyone should be extroverted sales person. I wanted a structured approach, but not a template. Like, ask me questions, understand my situation, and then help me plan. Also, I wanted confidentiality, and I wanted someone who can challenge me without shaming me.
Anna: Challenge without shaming. Can you unpack that?
Tobias: Yes. Like, it is okay if someone says, Tobias, you avoid conflict, you need to practice. That is challenge. But if someone says, Tobias, you are too sensitive, everyone feels that, just toughen up, then it feels like, you are not okay as you are. That is shame. And then I close.
Anna: That distinction will matter later, I think.
Tobias: Yes.
4)  Human coaching: experience and trust
Anna: Let us go into the private coaching experience. How did you find the coach, and why did you choose them?
Tobias: I found him on LinkedIn. He had a lot of content, like, posts about career acceleration, engineering to leadership, that kind of thing. He positioned himself as former consultant, now coach, and he had testimonials. He also had a website, very polished. I was, like, okay, he is professional. And he offered a package, like, three sessions, plus some worksheets, and support by email.
Anna: What made you believe he would fit you?
Tobias: He said he worked with engineers. And he spoke about structure, like, we build a strategy, we clarify your value proposition, we plan next steps. That sounded good. And he had this thing, like, engineers are undervalued because they do not market themselves. That hit me. I was, like, yes, that is me.
Anna: How much was the package, roughly?
Tobias: It was around, um, 900 euros for three sessions. Something like that. It felt expensive, but I told myself, okay, investment.
Anna: What were your expectations for session one?
Tobias: I expected that he would ask about my background, my job, what I want, what frustrates me. I expected, like, listening, and then maybe a framework. I also expected some empathy, not therapy, but, like, understanding. And I expected confidentiality.
Anna: Okay. Walk me through session one, in detail. Where were you, what was the format, what happened?
Tobias: It was on Zoom. I was at home, in my small office corner. I even took notes. I was nervous. He joined, he was very energetic, like, hi Tobias, great to meet you, we will make you unstoppable. That kind of vibe. And I was, like, okay, a bit much, but fine.
Anna: What happened next?
Tobias: He started with, like, a pitch. He talked for maybe ten minutes about his method. Like, I have a proven system, engineers go through these steps, and then they either move to consulting or leadership. He used those words a lot. Proven, system, method. And I was thinking, okay, but what about me.
Anna: Did you feel space to interrupt?
Tobias: Not really. He was talking fast. I tried to say, yes, I work in a supplier, and he was like, yes, yes, automotive, I know, very hierarchical, and then he continued. It felt like he already knew the story.
Anna: Was there a specific moment when trust dropped sharply for you?
Tobias: Yes.  It was when I described my performance review. I said, I feel under recognized, I do a lot, and the feedback is vague, and I feel frustrated, and also I feel, like, maybe I am too quiet, but I do not want to play politics. And he said, literally, everyone feels that. Everyone thinks they are under recognized. It is not special. You need to stop complaining and start acting.
Anna: How did that land in your body, in that moment?
Tobias: My stomach dropped. Like, physically. I felt heat in my face. And my throat got tight. I remember I stopped breathing for a second.It felt like, okay, I made myself vulnerable, and he slapped it away. And then I became very careful.
Anna: What did you do after that in the conversation?
Tobias: I said, okay, yes, maybe. And I started to speak more generally. I did not share, for example, that I had some conflict with a senior colleague, or that I sometimes feel anxious before reviews. I was not going to give him that information after that.
Anna: So you moved from specifics to safer surface.
Tobias: Exactly. Psychological safety went down. I did not use those words then, but that is what it was.
Anna: What did he do after saying that?
Tobias: He went into, like, narrative. He asked, what is your long term goal. I said, I want to be a senior engineer, maybe lead small team, but also stay technical. And he said, okay, then the fastest route is consulting. Because in consulting you learn to communicate, you get visibility, you get salary, and then you can go back to industry at a higher level. He said it like it is obvious.
Anna: And how did you respond?
Tobias: I said, I am not sure consulting fits me. I like engineering. And he said, that is just fear. Engineers always say they like engineering, but what they really want is recognition and money, and consulting gives that. And then he did something that felt judgmental. He said, you are the typical introverted engineer who hides behind technical details, and you need to become more of a leader type.
Anna: That felt like a personality judgment.
Tobias: Yes. Because it was said with this, like, smile, like, I see through you. And I was thinking, you do not know me. Also, introverted is not a problem. And he used it like a diagnosis. Like, here is your defect.
Anna: Did you say anything back?
Tobias: Not really. I laughed awkwardly. Like, hahahah, maybe. But inside I was, like, no. And then I started to distrust his intentions. I thought, he wants to sell a narrative that fits his method, not my situation.
Anna: You used the word intentions. What did you think his intention was?
Tobias: It felt salesy. Like, he has a product, and the product is, push engineers to consulting or leadership branding. And I was not a person, I was a case. Like, case number 47. He even used examples, like, I had a client, mechanical engineer, moved to consulting, doubled salary. And I was, like, okay, but that is not necessarily my goal. Also, it felt like he was proud of that path, because he was consultant before. So he was biased.
Anna: That is very clear. Did he offer anything concrete in that session that you could take away?
Tobias: Yes, and that is the annoying part. He gave a framework that is actually not stupid. He said, you need to define your value proposition in three parts. Your technical skill, your business impact, and your leadership behaviors. And then you need to collect evidence for each, like projects, metrics, examples. He also suggested a structure for talking to your manager. Like, do not ask, can I get promotion. Instead, say, here is what I delivered, here is how it links to company goals, here is what I want next, and what support I need.
Anna: That sounds reasonable.
Tobias: It is reasonable. If someone I trust would say it, I would do it. But because he said it after invalidating me and labeling me, I did not want to engage. It felt like, if I follow his framework, I accept his worldview. And I did not want that.
Anna: That is a perfect example of separating usefulness from trust. Low trust, some usefulness, but you could not use it fully.
Tobias: Yes. I even received a PDF after the call, like worksheets. And I opened it once, and I felt annoyed. I closed it.
Anna: What happened at the end of session one? Was there a plan for session two?
Tobias: He proposed homework, like, fill in the value proposition, and next session we refine and maybe discuss consulting options. And he said, if you are serious, you need to commit. And I said, yes, okay, I will do it. But inside I was already out.
Anna: Did you communicate your discomfort to him?
Tobias: No. And that is also part of the problem. I did not trust him enough to say, hey, what you said hurt. I did not think it would be safe. I imagined he would say, see, you are sensitive. So I just avoided.
Anna: What did you do between session one and the next scheduled session?
Tobias: I did not do homework. I procrastinated. I felt stress when I saw the calendar invite. Like, I had this tight feeling. And then I wrote him an email, like, I need to pause for now due to workload. Something polite. He responded fast, like, okay, but remember, success requires consistency. It was like a motivational poster.
Anna: And you stopped attending.
Tobias: Yes. I did not go to session two. I lost the money basically. And that also made me angry at myself. Like, why did you do that.
Anna: If you look back, what are the key reasons trust ruptured so quickly?
Tobias: Three things. One, dismissal. Everyone feels that. It killed the feeling of being taken seriously. Two, pre made narrative. Consulting is the solution. He did not explore alternatives. Three, judgment. Labeling my personality in a negative way. And also, maybe a fourth, lack of boundaries. Like, he did not ask about confidentiality, he did not ask what I am comfortable sharing. He just assumed.
Anna: If we zoom out, what does trust mean for you in a human coach relationship. What are the drivers?
Tobias: Being listened to, actually listening, not waiting to speak. Confidentiality, like clear statement. Non judgment, like you can challenge but not shame. Adapting to context, like automotive supplier reality, not generic Silicon Valley story. Transparent process, like, today we do this, why we do it. And boundaries, like, what is coaching, what is not. Also not being too salesy. Like, if I feel I am a revenue stream, I cannot trust.
Anna: That is a strong list. What are distrust drivers, basically the opposite?
Tobias: Templates. Invalidation. Salesy vibe. Pushing consulting. Personality judgment. And also over confidence. Like, when someone says, I have the proven method, then I think, okay, you will not listen.
Anna: After that experience, how did it affect you emotionally or behaviorally when seeking support?
Tobias: I became more cautious. Like, I did not want to talk to another coach. I also became more careful at work. Because it confirmed this fear that if you share frustration, people will dismiss you. So I kept it inside more. But also, weirdly, it made me clearer about my boundaries. Like, now I know what I do not want.
Anna: Mm. That is an after effect that can be both negative and informative.
Tobias: Yes.
Anna: One more detail on this. You said the advice was not necessarily wrong, but distrust prevented depth and follow through. Can you give one example of something you did not tell him because of distrust, that could have mattered?
Tobias: Yes. I did not tell him about a specific incident. There was a project where a test failed, and I found the root cause and I proposed a change, and it solved it. But in the meeting, my manager presented it as the team, and my name was not mentioned. And I was really upset. I wanted to talk about that, because it is about recognition, and also about how to communicate. But after he dismissed me, I was not going to share that. That story would require vulnerability. And I knew he would probably say, everyone has that, just be louder. And I did not want that.
Anna: That makes sense. Okay.
5) AI tools: experience and trust

5A. AI as structured reflection partner after the bad coaching
Anna: After you stopped the coaching, you mentioned you switched to a mix of AI reflection and a trusted senior colleague. Let us start with AI. What tools do you use, and for what exactly?
Tobias: Mostly ChatGPT. Sometimes also another tool integrated in the browser, but mainly ChatGPT. I use it in German and English. And I use it not for technical design, like not for CAD obviously, but for thinking and communication.
Anna: Can you describe a typical use case?
Tobias: The most common is preparation for conversations. Like, if I want to talk to my manager about development, I write a rough description of my situation, and I ask, help me structure this. What is a clear agenda. What are questions I can ask. How can I phrase it in a calm way. Because I tend to either be too emotional inside or too passive outside. AI helps me find a middle.
Anna: So it is like a rehearsal.
Tobias: Yes, rehearsal, and also clarity. It asks me questions sometimes if I prompt it that way. Like, what do you actually want. What are your constraints. And I answer, and then I see patterns. It is like journaling but more structured.
Anna: Do you use it for decision trade offs too?
Tobias: Yes. Like, should I stay and try internal move, or leave. I can list pros and cons. But I try not to let it decide. It is more, it helps me see the decision more clearly.
Anna: Do you use it for concrete documents?
Tobias: Sometimes. Like, drafting an email to a senior colleague, asking for advice. Or drafting a development plan. Or rewriting bullet points for my internal profile. We have internal systems, like, you need to write competencies. I hate writing that. AI helps.
Anna: How does trust play out for you with AI tools. Do you trust them?
Tobias: It is different. I trust it as a tool, not as a person. So trust means, is it useful, is it consistent, does it keep my data private, things like that. But emotionally, it cannot shame me. That is important. Like, AI does not say, you are too sensitive. Unless you prompt it badly. 
Anna: That is an interesting point. So psychological safety is higher because there is no judgment vibe.
Tobias: Yes. I can type something stupid, and it will respond. It might be wrong, but it is not judging. So I am more open. But I also do not fully trust its advice, because sometimes it is generic, or it says confident things that are not correct.
Anna: Can you give an example where it was not correct or not helpful?
Tobias: It once suggested, like, in German companies you can just ask HR for promotion criteria and they will provide it. That is, in my experience, naive. HR will give you generic guidelines, but the real criteria are political. So I learned, do not take it literally. Another example, it sometimes suggests, just set boundaries and say no. But in a project context, you cannot just say no. You need a strategy. So I have to adapt.
Anna: So AI is supportive, but not a magic solution.
Tobias: Exactly. It is like a calculator for words. But you need to know what you want.
Anna: Do you have privacy concerns?
Tobias: Yes. I never put confidential company data. I never put names. I abstract. Like, I say, mid size supplier, manager, senior colleague. And I also do not paste internal documents. I keep it general. So trust is conditional.
Anna: How did you start using AI in this way. Was it directly after the coaching?
Tobias: Pretty much. I was angry and I needed to process. I did not want to talk to friends too much because I felt ashamed, like, I wasted money. So I wrote it into AI. Like, here is what happened, help me understand. And it gave me language. Like, it said, this sounds invalidating, and you experienced a trust rupture. And I was like, yes, exactly. It gave me words.
Anna: That language helped you make sense of it.
Tobias: Yes.
Anna: Do you ever miss the human element with AI. Like empathy, accountability?
Tobias: Accountability, yes. AI cannot make me do the thing. It can suggest. But if I am scared to talk to my manager, AI cannot look at me and say, okay, now do it. And empathy, it can simulate, but it is still, you know, not real. Sometimes I want someone to say, I see you, and mean it. AI cannot mean it.
Anna: That is a nice way to put it.
Tobias: But still, I prefer it over a bad coach. 
6. Human vs AI comparison via specific tasks

Anna: I want to do a more concrete comparison. I will name a task, and you tell me whether you would prefer a human coach, AI tool, or a mix, and why. Ready?
Tobias: Yes.
Anna: Task one. Clarifying what you want from your career in the next one to two years.
Tobias: Mix. AI helps me list options and clarify values. Human, like a mentor, helps me reality check. Because AI can be too generic. Mentor can say, in this company, that path is possible or not.
Anna: Task two. Preparing for a conversation with your manager about recognition, promotion, or responsibilities.
Tobias: AI first, then human if available. AI helps structure and write. But a human who knows the politics is crucial. My senior colleague can tell me, do not phrase it like this, because manager will hear it as complaint. Or, mention this project because it is visible. AI cannot know that.
Anna: Task three. Emotional processing, like frustration, feeling undervalued.
Tobias: Honestly, AI is easier for the first draft, because no judgment. But a human friend or mentor is better if I trust them. The problem is, trust. With the coach, I did not trust, so it was useless. With AI, it is safer, but also shallow sometimes. So again, hybrid.
Anna: Task four. Understanding the career ladder and what skills matter for recognition in automotive supplier culture.
Tobias: Human, definitely. Someone inside or with deep industry knowledge. AI can give general ideas, but it does not know the informal parts. Like, who sponsors you, how you get on certain projects, how titles work. That is very specific.
Anna: Task five. Building a concrete plan with steps you actually execute.
Tobias: That is interesting. AI can produce a plan, but I might not execute. Human can create accountability. But again, only if I trust them. My senior colleague, because he is not selling me something, he is just helping, that creates accountability. So human mentor plus AI plan drafting.
Anna: Great.
7) Trust–effectiveness link

Anna: Now I want to explicitly talk about the link between trust and perceived effectiveness. In your story, it sounds like distrust prevented depth and follow through. Can you describe that mechanism in your own words?
Tobias: Yes. When I distrust the person, I do not share real information. I share a safe version. Then the advice is based on wrong or incomplete input. So even if the advice is good, it is not tailored. Also, I do not feel motivated to act on it, because acting feels like accepting their authority. And if I think their intentions are not aligned, I resist. So the effectiveness drops. Not because the advice is wrong, but because I do not engage.
Anna: That is very precise. If you compare that to higher trust situations, like with your senior colleague, what changes?
Tobias: I share more specifics. Like, I can say, I feel angry because my name was not mentioned. And he can respond with nuance, not dismiss. Then his advice fits. And because I trust him, I am willing to try. And then I get results. Like, I actually had better conversations.
Anna: So trust increases willingness to act, which increases perceived effectiveness.
Tobias: Exactly.
Anna: Can you give one example of something you actually executed because of AI preparation, and one example because of the senior colleague?
Tobias: AI example. I used AI to draft an agenda for my performance review follow up. Like, I asked my manager for a short check in, not the annual, but a mid year. I prepared three points. One, recap achievements with examples. Two, ask for criteria for the next level. Three, propose a next responsibility, like owning a small module. I wrote it in a calm, structured email. Before, I would write something messy or not write at all. I sent it. My manager agreed to a meeting. That happened.
Anna: And the senior colleague example?
Tobias: He helped me choose which achievements matter. I was listing technical details, like I improved tolerance stack. He said, nobody cares. He said, translate it to impact. Like, reduced rework, avoided delay, improved customer satisfaction. He also told me, mention the customer escalation you solved, because that is visible. And he told me how to say it without sounding arrogant. So in the meeting, I used that. And my manager reacted better. He actually said, okay, I see you want to move forward, let us define a plan.
Anna: That is a concrete outcome.
Tobias: Yes. It is not promotion yet. But it is movement.
8) Preferences and hybrid model reaction

Anna: You already described a hybrid approach. Can you tell me more about the senior colleague mentorship. How did that start, and what makes it trustworthy for you?
Tobias: He is a senior engineer, maybe 42, in a different team but close. We worked together on a project. He is respected, but he is not political in an aggressive way. He is calm. After my coaching disaster, I was venting a bit at lunch, carefully, and he said, if you want, we can talk. And I hesitated, because I did not want to appear weak. But he said, listen, everyone has this, but the difference is how you navigate. And he did not say it like dismissal. He said it with empathy, like, I had it too.
Anna: The same phrase, everyone has this, can be dismissal or connection, depending how it is said.
Tobias: Exactly. That is the point. The coach said it like, shut up. The colleague said it like, you are not alone. Big difference.
Anna: What are the boundaries of that mentorship?
Tobias: It is informal. We meet maybe once a month, sometimes just coffee. I do not dump everything. It is focused. I bring one topic. Like, how to talk to manager, how to move internally, what training is useful. He also said clearly, I cannot make decisions for you, and I cannot promise promotion. That transparency builds trust.
Anna: And confidentiality?
Tobias: I trust him more than internal programs because he is not HR. He is not reporting. But still, I am careful. I do not mention names when it is sensitive. But I think he respects it.
Anna: If you imagine a hybrid model, where AI helps you prepare, and then a human coach or mentor supports key decisions, how does that sound?
Tobias: That sounds ideal, if the human part is ethical and adaptive. Like, I would use AI to organize my thoughts, then the human would help contextualize and challenge me. Also, the human could help with accountability. But I would need to feel that the human is not pushing a template.
Anna: If a human coach could demonstrate clear boundaries, process, and adaptation, would your skepticism reduce?
Tobias: Yes, but slowly. I would probably ask more questions upfront now. Like, what is your approach, how do you handle confidentiality, how do you adapt. I would test. I am skeptical of marketing.
Anna: What would be a green flag in the first 10 minutes of a first session?
Tobias: A green flag is, they ask, what do you want from this, and they actually listen. They summarize my situation accurately. They do not jump to solution. They ask permission for sensitive topics. They explain the process, like today we map your situation, then we decide next steps. And they do not make me feel weird for being quiet.
Anna: And a red flag?
Tobias: Too much talking from their side. Too much success stories. Too much, I have the system. And any comment that labels my personality as a problem.
9) Micro-poll ratings

Anna: I want to do a very short micro poll, just quick numbers, and then I will ask you to explain. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all and 10 is fully, how much do you currently trust human career coaches in general?
Tobias:Right now, maybe 4.
Anna: 4 out of 10. What drives that number?
Tobias: I know there are good coaches. Friends had good experiences. So it is not zero. But my experience made me cautious. And I think the market has many people selling templates. So trust is low until proven.
Anna: On the same 0 to 10 scale, how much do you trust AI tools for career support?
Tobias: I would say 7.
Anna: 7. Why higher?
Tobias: Because the risk of judgment is lower, and it is consistent. It does not have ego. But it is not 10 because it can be wrong, and privacy is a concern.
Anna: Next, perceived effectiveness. For your situation specifically, how effective was the human coaching you experienced?
Tobias: For my situation, maybe 2.
Anna: 2 out of 10. What makes it that low?
Tobias: Because I did not continue, I did not do the work, I did not trust, so it did not change anything. The only effectiveness was, it taught me what I do not want, but that is not what I paid for.
Anna: And for AI tools, perceived effectiveness for your situation?
Tobias: I would say 6.
Anna: 6. What makes it a 6 and not higher?
Tobias: It helped me take steps, like preparing conversations. It gave me structure. But it cannot fully understand context and politics, and it cannot replace a human ally. Also, sometimes it is too generic.
Anna: Perfect. That is the micro poll. Thank you.
10) Closing
Anna: We are coming to the end. Is there anything important about your experience that we did not cover, something you would want a researcher to understand?
Tobias: Nothing from my side.
Anna: Thank you. 
Tobias: Thank you. It was actually helpful to talk about it.
Anna: I am glad. Have a good evening.
Tobias: You too. Bye.
