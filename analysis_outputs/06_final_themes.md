# Final themes

## AI valued for fast production and wording improvements

**Definition:** AI is valued for fast drafting and polishing outputs but is constrained by authenticity and accuracy concerns.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Anna: This is an interview about your experiences with career support, including human coaching and AI tools for career questions. It’s voluntary, you can skip any question, and you can stop anytime. With your permission, Im recording it to record audio for transcription.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L7-L7)

> Anna: Yes, exactly. We’ll anonymize everything and use a pseudonym like “Daniel,” and remove identifying details. Are there any topics you’d prefer not to discuss?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L9-L9)

> Daniel: LinkedIn mainly. Also company career pages. Sometimes Wellfound.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L33-L33)

> Daniel: And sometimes I use ChatGPT for rewriting bullet points or prepping for interviews.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L44-L44)

> Daniel: Advice that ignores context. Like, just network more, without understanding language barriers or how drained I am. Or just do a personal project, when I already did three and I also need money.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L48-L49)

> Daniel: Where are your metrics? And I said, i was freelance, I don’t have metrics. And he was like, then create metrics.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Daniel: And I was like… how? I can’t invent numbers. And he said, you can approximate.That triggered a trust issue for me.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Anna: And you said one session felt truly helpful. Can you describe that one?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L60-L60)

> Daniel: She started by asking questions: my story, what I tried, what I want, constraints. She asked about my German level, and how I present myself in interviews. She also asked what stability means for me like contract, team, insurance.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L61-L61)

> Daniel: She was fully present. She took notes and told me she’s taking notes. She shared her screen and made a little structure, goal constraints strengths, gaps, actions.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L63-L63)

## Human trust built through presence, empathy, and structure

**Definition:** Trust in human coaching hinges on perceived presence, empathy, and structured inquiry that signal care and competence.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Anna: This is an interview about your experiences with career support, including human coaching and AI tools for career questions. It’s voluntary, you can skip any question, and you can stop anytime. With your permission, Im recording it to record audio for transcription.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L7-L7)

> Anna: Yeah, my mother does the same hahaha. I understand. What about more formal support like career services, mentors, coaches?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L41-L41)

> Daniel: Basic stuff. It felt generic and more for traditional roles. And then I used ADPList, which is more design-specific.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L42-L42)

> Daniel: Context-blind advice. 4) Human coaching: experience & trust
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L48-L49)

> Anna: You mentioned ADPList. Can you walk me through your experience? How many sessions did you did, what you expected, and how it went overall?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L50-L50)

> Daniel: I used ADPList maybe six sessions over about a year, with different mentors. I expected portfolio feedback, career direction, maybe interview prep.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L51-L51)

> Daniel: Yeah. One mentor was a senior designer at a huge tech company. I booked him because I thought he’d know about hiring.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Anna: Was there anything about safety or confidentiality that mattered in that moment?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L58-L58)

> Daniel: Yeah, because it’s a stranger. You’re already a bit vulnerable. And when someone is distracted, you don’t feel safe to open up.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L59-L59)

> Daniel: That was with a mentor who worked at a mid-size German company. She was also an immigrant, from Brazil. And I think it mattered because she understood the stress.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L61-L61)

## Effectiveness defined by actionable guidance and clarity

**Definition:** Effectiveness is judged by concrete next steps, clarity of positioning, and decision confidence.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Daniel: And then a meditation app where it was more UI polish. Sometimes I do end-to-end research planning, interviews, journey maps, wireframes, prototyping in Figma, handoff. But in small projects it’s often like we need UI by next Friday, so you don’t do proper research, you just guess.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L29-L29)

> Daniel: Something actionable. Like, change this section of your case study, or your headline is unclear, or here are keywords you’re missing.If it’s concrete, I can do it. If it’s motivational talk, it feels nice for a moment, but then I still don’t know what to do.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L46-L46)

> Daniel: She was fully present. She took notes and told me she’s taking notes. She shared her screen and made a little structure, goal constraints strengths, gaps, actions.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L63-L63)

> Daniel: Overconfidence, generic advice, distraction. Also when mentors push their own path like it’s universal. And sometimes the power imbalance, like they treat take-home tasks as nothing, but for me it’s unpaid time I can’t afford.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L69-L70)

> Anna: Can you give a concrete example where it helped?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L73-L73)

> Daniel: But she didn’t give concrete actions. I left feeling warm, but nothing changed.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L114-L114)

> Daniel: 8) Preferences & hybrid model reaction
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L120-L121)

> Anna: Imagine a hybrid model where AI helps you prepare and organize things, and a human coach steps in for deeper conversations and decision points. What’s your reaction?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L122-L122)

> Daniel: AI first i upload my CV and two job descriptions, it gives adjustments and a checklist. Then human: 45 minutes to decide my positioning and narrative, and to commit to a plan. And maybe a short follow-up with next steps for accountability.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L140-L140)

> Daniel: If I have a plan I actually believe in, and I feel less scattered. Ideally it leads to interviews, but even without that, effectiveness is knowing what to do and why.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L142-L142)

## Contextual understanding (Germany, language, immigration) drives relevance

**Definition:** Context-aware support (language, immigration, market norms) increases perceived relevance and trust.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Daniel: Okay. 2) Participant context & career situation
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L12-L13)

> Daniel: Okay, um… I’m 24, I’m a UX/UI designer. I’m in Germany now, in Berlin. I moved here almost three years ago.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L15-L15)

> Daniel: Honestly… whether I should stay in UX or pivot to something differentt. Like product, or maybe UI-only, or even something outside design. Because the junior UX market feels saturated, and also the German language requirement blocks me a lot.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L19-L19)

> Daniel: In Germany I tried StepStone, but it’s very German. And I go to some meetups—UX meetups, design systems meetups. I tried portfolio reviews too.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L33-L33)

> Daniel: Advice that ignores context. Like, just network more, without understanding language barriers or how drained I am. Or just do a personal project, when I already did three and I also need money.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L48-L49)

> Daniel: Context-blind advice. 4) Human coaching: experience & trust
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L48-L49)

> Daniel: It dropped. I trusted his competence in big-tech storytelling, but I didn’t trust his alignment with me, and I didn’t trust the ethics of what he was suggesting. Also he didn’t ask questions about my situation, Germany, language, anything.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L57-L57)

> Daniel: That was with a mentor who worked at a mid-size German company. She was also an immigrant, from Brazil. And I think it mattered because she understood the stress.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L61-L61)

> Daniel: She suggested I apply to “Product Designer” roles instead of “UX/UI Designer,” because in Germany the naming is different. She also told me to add a line like Deutsch B1 working on it instead of hiding it. That felt honest.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L65-L65)

> Daniel: One time I asked how to answer Why did you move to Germany? and it gave me this super polished, fake-sounding story about german innovation culture, and it didn’t sound like me. It also assumed a visa type incorrectly, like it just made an assumption.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L76-L76)

## Emotional comfort helps but is insufficient alone

**Definition:** Emotional reassurance provides temporary relief but does not substitute for actionable guidance.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Anna: When you need career support like practical or emotional then who or what do you usually turn to?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L39-L39)

> Anna: Do you ever use it for emotional support during the job search?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L81-L81)

> Daniel: Sometimes. When I get rejected I ask how to cope. It’s comforting in a shallow way because it doesn’t judge me.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L82-L83)

> Daniel: But it doesn’t replace a friend. 6) Human vs AI comparison via tasks
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L82-L83)

> Daniel: Yeah. AI can be effective but not trusted, like it writes something good but I don’t trust it’s authentic or accurate. And trusted but not effective is like emotional comfort—safe, but not changing anything long-term.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L120-L121)

> Simon: Practical and emotional, both. Practical as in how do I position myself, how do I explain the physics background, how do I write a CV that fits the German style, how do I prepare for ML interviews, and also how do I negotiate, like salary, contract terms, and Blue Card stuff. Emotional support is more like am I making a mistake moving countries, what if I fail, what if I do not fit in.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L269-L269)

> Simon: Also it is a signal that my salary and contract are in a good range. But it is also paperwork, and it depends on rules, and rules can change. So it is not pure comfort, but it is better than being on student status.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L311-L311)

> Simon: And maybe accountability, like, if I say I will do X, then they check. Also maybe help with negotiation and career planning. And honestly, emotional support too, like someone who can listen and reflect back, because moving countries and building a career is stressful.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L363-L363)

> Anna: Did you notice any emotional impact from that process? Like confidence, stress level?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L432-L432)

> Simon: Safe means confidentiality, not being judged, not being exploited, like not being manipulated. Also trust includes empathy for humans, like feeling understood. For AI, empathy is not real, but you can still feel comfortable if it is respectful and consistent.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L615-L615)

## Ethical boundaries and honesty as trust anchors

**Definition:** Perceived ethical breaches (e.g., inventing metrics) undermine trust and legitimacy.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Daniel: And I was like… how? I can’t invent numbers. And he said, you can approximate.That triggered a trust issue for me.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Daniel: I don’t want to lie.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Daniel: It dropped. I trusted his competence in big-tech storytelling, but I didn’t trust his alignment with me, and I didn’t trust the ethics of what he was suggesting. Also he didn’t ask questions about my situation, Germany, language, anything.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L57-L57)

> Daniel: It also gave me versions without fake metrics, if I ask it not to invent numbers. That helped me upgrade the tone.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L74-L74)

> Daniel: Because it actually improved the output my CV language, cover letters, and speed. I got more replies when my documents were clearer. It doesn’t solve direction, but it helps a lot with production.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L109-L109)

> Daniel: The big tech mentor. His advice had useful parts impact, decision-making story, stronger narrative. But I didn’t trust him because he seemed okay with exaggerating and he was distracted.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L116-L116)

> Daniel: Trust is like a multiplier.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L118-L118)

> Daniel: If I have a plan I actually believe in, and I feel less scattered. Ideally it leads to interviews, but even without that, effectiveness is knowing what to do and why.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L142-L142)

> Simon: And because we are small, I also do product things, like talking to the product manager, translating client pain points into model requirements, writing internal docs, and sometimes presenting results to clients. It is very fast. Like, you ship fast, then you fix.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L281-L281)

> Simon: I found it through LinkedIn plus a meetup connection. I went to a machine learning meetup in Munich, like one of those evening events with pizza, and I talked to someone who later became my internal referral. Then I applied on LinkedIn, and the process was: first a recruiter screen, then a technical interview with an ML engineer, then a take-home assignment.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L287-L287)

## Privacy caution limits disclosure to AI

**Definition:** Privacy concerns limit what participants share with AI tools, shaping trust and usage.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Daniel: Yeah, that’s okay. As long as it’s anonymous, right?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L8-L8)

> Anna: Yes, exactly. We’ll anonymize everything and use a pseudonym like “Daniel,” and remove identifying details. Are there any topics you’d prefer not to discuss?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L9-L9)

> Anna: Do you have privacy concerns when using it?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L77-L77)

> Daniel: Yes. I don’t paste sensitive info. I remove company names sometimes, or I generalize.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L78-L78)

> Daniel: Transparency about what AI does and doesn’t do. Privacy. And quality of matching for the human part.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L127-L127)

> Anna: Thanks, Daniel. I’m stopping the recording now. And just to reiterate, everything will be anonymized.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L145-L145)

> Anna: Is it okay if I m recording the audio of this interview? The recording is only for transcription, it will be anonymized, and you can skip any question or stop at any time.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L220-L220)

> Simon: Also kindness or empathy,or  like when they should listen properly, not rush not judge and confidentiality. Because career topics can be sensitive, like visa status, salary, insecurities. I need to feel safe that they do not share it or use it in a weird way.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L369-L369)

> Simon: Privacy. Like, CV contains personal info. I tried to remove name, address, company names, but still, you share your career story.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L465-L465)

> Simon: Also privacy concerns reduce trust a bit.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L561-L561)

## Generic or template advice erodes trust

**Definition:** Template or surface-level advice signals misalignment and reduces willingness to disclose or act.

**Boundaries:** Applies when the extract explicitly references trust, effectiveness, or support quality in relation to this theme.

**Key extracts:**

> Daniel: Basic stuff. It felt generic and more for traditional roles. And then I used ADPList, which is more design-specific.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L42-L42)

> Daniel: A lot were surface-level. Like they glance at the portfolio and say looks good, and then they talk about their own career a lot. And I’m sitting there thinking, okay, but what do I do tomorrow?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L53-L53)

> Daniel: It was like a template advice.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L57-L57)

> Daniel: Overconfidence, generic advice, distraction. Also when mentors push their own path like it’s universal. And sometimes the power imbalance, like they treat take-home tasks as nothing, but for me it’s unpaid time I can’t afford.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L69-L70)

> Daniel: Human or hybrid. AI gives generic lists. A human can ask about my preferences and constraints, and also understand Germany context.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L87-L87)

> Daniel: That sounds good. AI can handle the annoying part—rewriting, templates, checklists. And the human can do the meaning part and also verify reality.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L123-L123)

> Anna: Great, thanks. Just to confirm, we will use a pseudonym for you, and anything identifying like company name or specific people, we will keep generic. If I ask something that feels too specific, you can just say pass.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L226-L226)

> Anna: That is helpful. Can you describe the startup a bit, in a generic way, and what you do there day to day?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L278-L278)

> Simon: Also helpful is reality checks about the market, like, do not apply to only big tech, also look at middlestrandt or look at startups. Unhelpful is generic advice like, follow your passion, or network more, or just be confident. Like, yeah, okay, but what do I do tomorrow.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L329-L329)

> Simon: The questions they ask. If they ask generic questions like, what are your strengths, and then they give a generic summary, I would not feel seen. But if they pick up on details, like, you said you liked bridging technical and business, tell me more, and then they connect it to a plan, then I feel they actually listened.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L375-L375)
