> Anna: Yeah, my mother does the same hahaha. I understand. What about more formal support like career services, mentors, coaches?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L41-L41)

> Daniel: Basic stuff. It felt generic and more for traditional roles. And then I used ADPList, which is more design-specific.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L42-L42)

> Daniel: Context-blind advice. 4) Human coaching: experience & trust

> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L7-L7)

> Anna: Yes, exactly. We’ll anonymize everything and use a pseudonym like “Daniel,” and remove identifying details. Are there any topics you’d prefer not to discuss?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L9-L9)

> Daniel: LinkedIn mainly. Also company career pages. Sometimes Wellfound.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L33-L33)

> Daniel: And sometimes I use ChatGPT for rewriting bullet points or prepping for interviews.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L44-L44)

> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L48-L49)

## Privacy caution limits disclosure to AI (n=147)

**Top descriptive codes:** context sensitivity (204), language barrier (188), ai tool usage (95), human coaching experience (63), trust/safety experience (42)

> Daniel: Okay. 2) Participant context & career situation
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L12-L13)

> Daniel: Okay, um… I’m 24, I’m a UX/UI designer. I’m in Germany now, in Berlin. I moved here almost three years ago.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L15-L15)

> Daniel: Honestly… whether I should stay in UX or pivot to something differentt. Like product, or maybe UI-only, or even something outside design. Because the junior UX market feels saturated, and also the German language requirement blocks me a lot.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L19-L19)

> Daniel: In Germany I tried StepStone, but it’s very German. And I go to some meetups—UX meetups, design systems meetups. I tried portfolio reviews too.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L33-L33)

> Daniel: Advice that ignores context. Like, just network more, without understanding language barriers or how drained I am. Or just do a personal project, when I already did three and I also need money.

**Top descriptive codes:** actionability/structure (273), ai tool usage (112), human coaching experience (73), perceived effectiveness (57), trust/safety experience (32)

> Daniel: And then a meditation app where it was more UI polish. Sometimes I do end-to-end research planning, interviews, journey maps, wireframes, prototyping in Figma, handoff. But in small projects it’s often like we need UI by next Friday, so you don’t do proper research, you just guess.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L29-L29)

> Daniel: Something actionable. Like, change this section of your case study, or your headline is unclear, or here are keywords you’re missing.If it’s concrete, I can do it. If it’s motivational talk, it feels nice for a moment, but then I still don’t know what to do.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L46-L46)

> Daniel: She was fully present. She took notes and told me she’s taking notes. She shared her screen and made a little structure, goal constraints strengths, gaps, actions.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L63-L63)

> Daniel: Overconfidence, generic advice, distraction. Also when mentors push their own path like it’s universal. And sometimes the power imbalance, like they treat take-home tasks as nothing, but for me it’s unpaid time I can’t afford.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L69-L70)

> Anna: Can you give a concrete example where it helped?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L73-L73)

## Hybrid models preferred for division of labor (n=132)
**Top descriptive codes:** hybrid preference (132), ai tool usage (50), human coaching experience (45), actionability/structure (22), trust/safety experience (16)

> Daniel: And that bothers me.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L29-L29)

> Anna: What bothers you about it?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L30-L30)

> Daniel: After many rejections, I start thinking I’m the problem. But I also know the market is tough. So it’s both.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L37-L38)

> Daniel: Hybrid. AI for practicing phrasing and structure, human for feedback on how I come across, tone, confidence, if my story lands.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L89-L89)

> Daniel: 8) Preferences & hybrid model reaction
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L120-L121)

## Emotional comfort helps but is insufficient alone (n=175)
**Top descriptive codes:** emotional support (153), ai tool usage (56), human coaching experience (43), trust/safety experience (43), perceived effectiveness (23)

> Anna: When you need career support like practical or emotional then who or what do you usually turn to?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L39-L39)

> Anna: Do you ever use it for emotional support during the job search?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L81-L81)

> Daniel: Sometimes. When I get rejected I ask how to cope. It’s comforting in a shallow way because it doesn’t judge me.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L82-L83)

> Daniel: But it doesn’t replace a friend. 6) Human vs AI comparison via tasks
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L82-L83)

> Daniel: Yeah. AI can be effective but not trusted, like it writes something good but I don’t trust it’s authentic or accurate. And trusted but not effective is like emotional comfort—safe, but not changing anything long-term.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L120-L121)

## Generic or template advice erodes trust (n=134)
**Top descriptive codes:** ai tool usage (52), human coaching experience (38), general career context (29), trust/safety experience (24), actionability/structure (18)

> Daniel: Basic stuff. It felt generic and more for traditional roles. And then I used ADPList, which is more design-specific.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L42-L42)

> Daniel: A lot were surface-level. Like they glance at the portfolio and say looks good, and then they talk about their own career a lot. And I’m sitting there thinking, okay, but what do I do tomorrow?
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L53-L53)

> Daniel: It was like a template advice.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L57-L57)

> Daniel: Overconfidence, generic advice, distraction. Also when mentors push their own path like it’s universal. And sometimes the power imbalance, like they treat take-home tasks as nothing, but for me it’s unpaid time I can’t afford.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L69-L70)

> Daniel: Human or hybrid. AI gives generic lists. A human can ask about my preferences and constraints, and also understand Germany context.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L87-L87)

## Ethical boundaries and honesty as trust anchors (n=152)
**Top descriptive codes:** ethical boundary concern (141), ai tool usage (49), human coaching experience (27), trust/safety experience (26), perceived effectiveness (13)

> Daniel: And I was like… how? I can’t invent numbers. And he said, you can approximate.That triggered a trust issue for me.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Daniel: I don’t want to lie.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L55-L55)

> Daniel: It dropped. I trusted his competence in big-tech storytelling, but I didn’t trust his alignment with me, and I didn’t trust the ethics of what he was suggesting. Also he didn’t ask questions about my situation, Germany, language, anything.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L57-L57)

> Daniel: It also gave me versions without fake metrics, if I ask it not to invent numbers. That helped me upgrade the tone.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L74-L74)

> Daniel: Because it actually improved the output my CV language, cover letters, and speed. I got more replies when my documents were clearer. It doesn’t solve direction, but it helps a lot with production.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L109-L109)

## Matching and fit determine coaching value (n=80)
**Top descriptive codes:** matching/fit (72), ai tool usage (31), human coaching experience (28), trust/safety experience (16), language barrier (9)

> Daniel: But it has to be a good match.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L87-L87)

> Daniel: Transparency about what AI does and doesn’t do. Privacy. And quality of matching for the human part.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L127-L127)

> Anna: Matching seems central for you.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L128-L128)

> Daniel: Yeah. My one good mentor worked because she understood the Germany market and immigrant stress. If a system matches me with someone who gets those constraints, trust goes up.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L129-L129)

> Daniel: That AI becomes too central and flattens nuance. Or the human just repeats what AI says, then why pay. And also I worry about incentives, like upselling or pushing me into a path that benefits the platform.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L131-L131)

## Trust amplifies effectiveness and implementation (n=2)
**Top descriptive codes:** trust/safety experience (2), ethical boundary concern (1)

> Daniel: Exactly. Trust makes implementation faster. Distrust makes me overthink.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L118-L118)

> Daniel: Trust is like a multiplier.
> (Master Interviews Transcripts.txt:L118-L118)
