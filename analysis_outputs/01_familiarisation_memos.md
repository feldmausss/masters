# Familiarisation memos

Patterns noted across transcripts:

- Trust in humans rises with presence, empathy, and structured questioning; distraction or template advice reduces disclosure.
- AI is trusted for fast wording support but doubted for authenticity, accuracy, and contextual nuance.
- Perceived effectiveness is framed as actionable clarity, concrete next steps, and improved outputs.
- Contextual constraints (Germany, language, immigration, paperwork) shape trust and perceived relevance.
- Hybrid usage is preferred: AI for prep/structure, humans for nuance, accountability, and meaning-making.
- Ethics/boundaries (not inventing metrics) are explicit trust triggers.
- Privacy caution limits what gets shared with AI; emotional comfort helps but rarely drives change.
